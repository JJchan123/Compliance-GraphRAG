Developed by the Board of the AI, this framework serves as a structured approach that not only defines the acceptable amount and type of risk but also guides decision-making and strategic planning processes. It encompasses a comprehensive set of policies, processes, and controls that ensure alignment with the organization's risk culture, thereby facilitating effective risk management practices. Ultimately, the risk appetite framework plays a vital role in helping the AI navigate its operational landscape while maintaining compliance with regulatory standards and achieving its goals.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 146, "prompt_tokens": 414, "total_tokens": 560, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
