This approach allows AIs to allocate resources effectively, focusing on higher-risk areas to enhance compliance with anti-money laundering (AML) and counter-terrorism financing (CFT) regulations. By emphasizing risk assessment, the Risk-Based Approach promotes a more efficient and effective compliance environment, ultimately contributing to the stability of the financial system.

CDD is essential for ensuring compliance with AML/CFT regulations, as it enables AIs to identify and mitigate potential risks effectively. The relationship between CDD and the Risk-Based Approach highlights the necessity of tailoring due diligence measures to the specific risks associated with individual customers, thereby fostering a secure financial environment.
