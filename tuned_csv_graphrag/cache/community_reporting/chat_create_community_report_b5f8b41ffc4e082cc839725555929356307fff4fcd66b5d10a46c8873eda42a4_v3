The HKMA employs a risk-based supervisory approach as its core methodology, integrating risk management ratings derived from risk-focused on-site examinations into the CAMEL rating system. The risk management rating evaluates the effectiveness of an AI's risk management systems and internal controls, influencing the overall CAMEL rating.
