These executive officers are responsible for ensuring compliance with anti-money laundering and counter-financing of terrorism (AML/CFT) requirements under the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing Ordinance (AMLO). The HKMA, acting as the Monetary Authority (MA), has the power to hold these officers accountable for any AML/CFT deficiencies identified within their institutions. Consequently, executive officers may face supervisory actions, including the withdrawal or suspension of their consent to act in their roles, if found responsible for misconduct or failures in AML/CFT compliance. This regulatory framework underscores the critical governance and risk management responsibilities entrusted to executive officers in maintaining the integrity of financial institutions under HKMA supervision.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 173, "prompt_tokens": 341, "total_tokens": 514, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
