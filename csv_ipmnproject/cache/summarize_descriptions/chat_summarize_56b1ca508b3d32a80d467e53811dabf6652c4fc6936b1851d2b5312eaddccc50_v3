This risk is recognized as one of the eight inherent risks that AIs must actively manage, as outlined by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA). It is categorized as a material risk area that should be thoroughly addressed in risk management reports. Furthermore, INTEREST RATE RISK encompasses various dimensions, including repricing risk, basis risk, options risk, and yield curve risk, all of which contribute to the overall financial condition of an AI.
