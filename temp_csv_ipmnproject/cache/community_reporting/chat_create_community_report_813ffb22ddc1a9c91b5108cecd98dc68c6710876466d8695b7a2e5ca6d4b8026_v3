The AML/CFT systems are comprehensive frameworks designed to ensure compliance with multiple legislative ordinances, including the Banking Ordinance, Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing Ordinance, Organized and Serious Crimes Ordinance, Drug Trafficking (Recovery of Proceeds) Ordinance, and the United Nations (Anti-Terrorism Measures) Ordinance. These systems encompass customer due diligence, accounting and control systems, and continuous monitoring processes to detect and prevent illicit activities such as money laundering and terrorist financing.

These systems are mandated to implement customer due diligence, record-keeping, and continuous monitoring to detect suspicious transactions and mitigate risks related to money laundering and terrorist financing. Their comprehensive nature ensures that institutions can effectively uphold regulatory standards and contribute to the integrity of the financial system. The AML/CFT systems are directly linked to multiple legislative ordinances, underscoring their centrality in the compliance ecosystem [Data: Entities (89), Relationships (246, 353, 364, 358, 359, 360)].\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"summary\": \"Legislative framework supporting AML/CFT systems\",\n      \"explanation\": \"The AML/CFT systems operate within a robust legislative framework comprising several key ordinances. The Banking Ordinance (Cap.155) mandates Authorized Institutions to maintain adequate accounting and control systems, which underpin the effective functioning of AML/CFT systems. The Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing Ordinance (Cap.615) specifically governs AML/CFT requirements, including customer due diligence and record-keeping. Additional ordinances such as the Organized and Serious Crimes Ordinance, Drug Trafficking (Recovery of Proceeds) Ordinance, and United Nations (Anti-Terrorism Measures) Ordinance impose legal obligations that AML/CFT systems must address, including prohibitions on dealing with proceeds of crime and compliance with UN Security Council Resolutions. This legislative network ensures comprehensive coverage of risks and legal compliance [Data: Entities (168, 167, 169, 170, 171), Relationships (355, 353, 358, 359, 360)].\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"summary\": \"Integration of accounting systems and internal controls\",\n      \"explanation\": \"Under the Banking Ordinance, Authorized Institutions are required to maintain adequate accounting systems and systems of control.

This process is fundamental to preventing money laundering and terrorist financing by enabling institutions to identify and assess risks associated with their customers. Effective CDD supports early detection of suspicious activities and is a key component of the AML/CFT systems, reflecting the proactive stance of regulatory frameworks in risk mitigation [Data: Entities (172, 167), Relationships (354, 353)].\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"summary\": \"Focus on combating terrorist financing within AML/CFT systems\",\n      \"explanation\": \"Terrorist financing represents a significant risk that AML/CFT systems specifically aim to detect and prevent.
