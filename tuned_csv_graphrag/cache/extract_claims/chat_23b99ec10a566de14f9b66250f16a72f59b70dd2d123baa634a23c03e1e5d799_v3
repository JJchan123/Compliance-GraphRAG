Risk management policies, procedures and limits.\nversion: V.3 - 06.10.2017.\n business line or unit (including the head and any other relevant principal officers of such business line or unit), should be spelled out clearly in the policies and procedures, and updated as appropriate.\n\n4.1.5 The risk management policies and procedures should keep pace with the changing environment. The Board or its designated committee(s) should review the risk management policies and key risk management procedures on a regular basis (e.g. at least annually). If the review is carried out by the Board’s committee(s) or senior management, any material amendment to the policies and procedures should be approved by the Board.\n\n4.1.6 Where appropriate, the risk management policies and procedures should also cover the use of risk-mitigating techniques (e.g. hedging, buying insurance protection or using credit derivatives). If AIs employ risk-mitigating techniques, they should understand the risk to be mitigated and the potential effects of that mitigation (including its effectiveness and enforceability), and have in place appropriate measures to control the risks associated with these techniques.\n\n4.2 Risk limits\n\n4.2.1 A set of limits should be put in place to control an AI’s exposure to various quantifiable risks associated with its business activities (e.g. credit risk, market risk, interest rate risk and liquidity risk). Limits should also be used to control different sources of risk concentration, including (i) those arising directly from exposures to borrowers and obligors or indirectly through investments backed by a particular asset type, e.g. collateralised debt obligations, and (ii) those resulting from similar exposures across different business activities. These limits should be documented and approved by the Board or its designated committee(s).\n\n4.2.2 Risk limits should be set in line with an AI’s risk appetite. To ensure consistency between risk limits and business strategies, the Board may wish to approve limits as part of the overall annual budget process.\n\n4.2.3 Risk limits should be suitable for the size and complexity of)\n\n<|COMPLETE|>", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 566, "prompt_tokens": 1573, "total_tokens": 2139, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 1024, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
