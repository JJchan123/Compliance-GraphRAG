The key entities include AIs, private banking relationships, offshore investment vehicles, and ultimate beneficial owners (UBOs). AIs maintain private banking relationships with high net worth clients or their offshore vehicles, which are corporate entities used as contractual parties. The ultimate beneficial owners are the true owners behind these offshore investment vehicles.
