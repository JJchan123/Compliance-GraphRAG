This function encompasses identifying, measuring, controlling, assessing, monitoring, and reporting various types of risks faced by the institution. It is supported by effective management information systems and staffed by knowledgeable personnel to ensure robust risk oversight. Acting as the second line of defence, the Risk Management Function operates independently from business units to provide objective oversight of risk-taking activities, conduct thorough risk assessments, and ensure compliance with regulatory and internal standards. Additionally, it plays a critical role in contingency planning, business continuity, and recovery efforts to maintain operational resilience. The function also oversees risk management processes related to new products and services, including monitoring approvals, maintaining detailed records, and enforcing formal approval procedures for significant changes, thereby safeguarding the institution’s risk profile and regulatory compliance.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 179, "prompt_tokens": 373, "total_tokens": 552, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
