Treasury-related changes encompass a broad range of modifications including product re-launches, market changes, distribution channel shifts, customer segment alterations, currency denomination adjustments, market positioning, platform transitions, process automation, booking arrangements, settlement methodologies, and documentation updates. These changes collectively influence various risk dimensions such as credit, market, operational, legal, and liquidity risks, thereby affecting the institutions' risk management and regulatory compliance under the HKMA framework.\",\n  \"findings\": [\n    {\n      \"summary\": \"Central role of Treasury-Related Changes in risk exposure\",\n      \"explanation\": \"Treasury-related changes act as a pivotal hub connecting multiple risk-impacting factors within the community. These changes include market shifts, distribution channel modifications, customer segment transitions, and operational process updates, among others. Each of these changes can significantly alter the risk exposure of Authorized Institutions by introducing new vulnerabilities or modifying existing risk profiles.
