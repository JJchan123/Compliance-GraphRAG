These letters serve as enforcement tools aimed at prompting corrective actions by management and/or the board of directors. They are typically issued for less serious compliance deficiencies, indicating a regulatory approach focused on remediation and improvement rather than immediate punitive measures. This mechanism ensures that compliance weaknesses are formally brought to the attention of senior management, thereby facilitating timely remediation efforts to strengthen the institution's compliance posture [Data: Entities (288)].\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"summary\": \"Management's primary responsibility for internal controls and compliance\",\n      \"explanation\": \"Within Authorized Institutions, management holds the primary responsibility for establishing and maintaining an effective system of internal controls.
