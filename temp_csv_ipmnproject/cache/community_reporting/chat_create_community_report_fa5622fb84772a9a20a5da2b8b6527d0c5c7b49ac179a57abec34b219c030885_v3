The BOARD plays a critical supervisory role by overseeing the adequacy of CAPITAL and ensuring that capital plans are consistent with the institution's risk appetite. MANAGEMENT ACTIONS represent the strategic measures taken by an organization's management to restore or maintain capital levels following adverse events, guided by the institution's risk appetite and risk measures. RISK MEASURE provides quantitative metrics that inform MANAGEMENT ACTIONS and capital planning, enabling proactive risk mitigation. These entities and their interrelationships form a structured framework that supports robust risk management and regulatory compliance within financial institutions.\",\n  \"findings\": [\n    {\n      \"summary\": \"The Board's oversight role on capital adequacy\",\n      \"explanation\": \"The BOARD is a pivotal entity responsible for overseeing the adequacy of CAPITAL within the authorized institution (AI). It ensures that capital plans are aligned with the institution's risk appetite, thereby maintaining financial stability and regulatory compliance. This oversight function is critical in supervising the institution's ability to absorb losses and sustain operations under adverse conditions, reflecting a governance commitment to sound risk management practices [Data: Relationships (1001)].\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"summary\": \"Management Actions as proactive risk mitigation measures\",\n      \"explanation\": \"MANAGEMENT ACTIONS encompass the possible measures and actionable steps that an organization's management may undertake in response to adverse events. These actions are designed to restore or maintain adequate capital levels after losses, as outlined in the risk appetite statement. By implementing these structured strategies, management demonstrates a proactive commitment to mitigating risks and ensuring financial resilience, which is essential for compliance with regulatory standards [Data: Entities (462), Relationships (1017)].\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"summary\": \"Risk Measure's role in informing management decisions\",\n      \"explanation\": \"RISK MEASURE provides quantitative metrics used to assess the magnitude of risks faced by the authorized institution.
