Specifically, the HKMA enforces the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT) framework, which serves as a critical tool for Authorized Institutions (AIs) in preventing financial crimes and ensuring adherence to regulatory standards. Through this framework, the HKMA not only guides AIs in their risk management strategies but also actively monitors and enforces compliance, thereby reinforcing the integrity of the financial system in Hong Kong.
