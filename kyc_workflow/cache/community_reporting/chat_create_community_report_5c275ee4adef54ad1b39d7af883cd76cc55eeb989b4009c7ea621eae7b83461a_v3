Key entities include Customer Information, On-going Due Diligence and Scrutiny, and Risk Profile. Customer Information forms the foundational data collected and verified by AIs to support due diligence and risk assessment. On-going Due Diligence and Scrutiny represents the continuous monitoring activities that utilize customer information to ensure transactional consistency with the customer's profile and risk characteristics. The Risk Profile entity guides the tailoring of due diligence efforts based on assessed risk levels. The relationships among these entities illustrate a structured flow from data collection to risk-based monitoring, reflecting the operationalization of AML/CFT systems within AIs.\",\n  \"findings\": [\n    {\n      \"summary\": \"Customer Information is foundational for AML/CFT compliance\",\n      \"explanation\": \"Customer Information encompasses critical personal details such as name, date of birth, nationality, Hong Kong identity card number, occupation or business, and address. Authorized Institutions (AIs) are mandated to collect and verify this information to facilitate effective customer due diligence and ongoing scrutiny. This foundational data supports the identification and verification processes essential for compliance with AML/CFT regulations, enabling AIs to understand their customers and assess potential risks accurately.
