Key entities include the Board of Directors, Board Designated Committees, Risk Committees, Senior Management, and the Chief Risk Officer, all of whom play distinct but interconnected roles in overseeing the AI's risk management system. The risk management system itself integrates components such as risk identification, risk measurement methods and models, risk monitoring and reporting systems, management information systems, validation rules, and communication systems. These components collectively support the identification, measurement, monitoring, and control of risks, including prudential concerns that may arise. The relationships among these entities and systems form a comprehensive governance and supervisory framework designed to ensure effective risk decision-making, compliance with regulatory requirements, and robust financial risk mitigation across the banking sector.\",\n  \"findings\": [\n    {\n      \"summary\": \"Board of Directors holds ultimate responsibility for risk management oversight\",\n      \"explanation\": \"The Board of Directors is the primary entity responsible for overseeing the adequacy and effectiveness of the AI's risk management framework and practices. This oversight role is supported through specialized structures such as Board Designated Committees and Risk Committees, which assist in reviewing risk management policies, risk measurement methods, and prudential concerns. The Board also engages in discussions of significant prudential issues identified during supervisory examinations, ensuring that governance remains responsive to emerging risks and compliance challenges [Data: Entities (400, 354, 101, 107), Relationships (854, 777, 855, 204)].\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"summary\": \"Risk Committees and Board Designated Committees provide specialized oversight functions\",\n      \"explanation\": \"Risk Committees are tasked with supervising risk management activities, reviewing risk exposures, and advising senior management and the Board.
