It evaluates inherent risks by business activity, the adequacy of risk management systems, and external risk factors to produce a comprehensive risk profile.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PLANNING THE SUPERVISORY WORK<|>SUPERVISORY PROCESS<|>Planning the supervisory work is a step in the risk-based supervisory methodology where supervisory activities are tailored and scheduled based on the AI’s risk profile and complexity to ensure focused and effective examination.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DEFINING EXAMINATION ACTIVITIES<|>SUPERVISORY PROCESS<|>Defining examination activities involves specifying the scope and nature of supervisory tasks to be performed, customized according to the AI’s risk profile and business complexity.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RISK TYPE<|>RISK TYPE<|>Risk types refer to the categories of inherent risks that an AI may face, including credit risk, market risk, interest rate risk, liquidity risk, operational risk, reputation risk, legal risk, and strategic risk, which are assessed during the risk assessment process.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NEW PRODUCT APPROVAL PROCESS<|>NEW PRODUCT APPROVAL PROCESS<|>The new product approval process is a procedure within an AI’s risk management framework to evaluate and authorize the introduction of new products, ensuring that associated risks are identified and managed before launch.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SENIOR MANAGEMENT<|>SENIOR MANAGEMENT<|>Senior management refers to the group of executives responsible for the day-to-day management of an AI, including implementing risk management policies and overseeing risk controls.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BOARD OF DIRECTORS<|>BOARD OF DIRECTORS<|>The board of directors is the governing body of an AI responsible for overall oversight, including approving risk management policies and ensuring effective risk governance.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RISK MANAGEMENT POLICY<|>RISK MANAGEMENT POLICY<|>Risk management policy comprises the formalized guidelines, procedures, and limits established by an AI to govern risk-taking activities and ensure risks are managed within acceptable parameters.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RISK LIMIT<|>RISK LIMIT<|>Risk limits are quantitative or qualitative thresholds set by an AI to control the level of risk exposure in various business activities, ensuring adherence to the risk appetite.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RISK APPETITE FRAMEWORK<|>RISK APPETITE FRAMEWORK<|>The risk appetite framework defines the amount and type of risk an AI is willing to accept in pursuit of its objectives, guiding risk-taking and management decisions.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RISK COMMITTEE<|>RISK COMMITTEE<|>The risk committee is a designated group within an AI, often comprising board members and senior management, responsible for overseeing risk management practices and ensuring alignment with the risk appetite framework.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHIEF RISK OFFICER<|>CHIEF RISK OFFICER<|>The chief risk officer (CRO) is a senior executive responsible for the development, implementation, and oversight of the AI’s risk management framework and policies.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>INTERNAL AUDIT FUNCTION<|>INTERNAL AUDIT FUNCTION<|>The internal audit function provides independent assurance on the effectiveness of risk management systems, controls, and governance processes within an AI.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>COMPLIANCE FUNCTION<|>COMPLIANCE

SYSTEM<|>AML/CFT SYSTEM<|>The Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT) system is a set of policies, procedures, and controls implemented by an AI to detect and prevent

that govern the operations, risk management, and compliance requirements of authorized institutions.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SUPERVISORY MEASURE<|>SUPERVISORY MEASURE<|>Supervisory measures are actions taken by the regulatory authority, such as the HKMA, to ensure compliance and address deficiencies in an AI’s risk management or operations.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ENFORCEMENT MEASURE<|>ENFORCEMENT MEASURE<|>Enforcement measures are formal regulatory actions imposed on an AI for violations of laws, regulations, or supervisory requirements, including penalties or restrictions.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FINANCIAL CRIME<|>FINANCIAL CRIME<|>Financial crime encompasses illegal activities such as fraud, money laundering, and terrorist financing that pose risks to the financial system and are addressed through risk management and compliance frameworks.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>INTERNATIONAL STANDARD<|>INTERNATIONAL STANDARD<|>International standards are globally recognized guidelines and best practices that inform the development of risk management frameworks and supervisory processes for authorized institutions.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FINANCIAL SECTOR STAKEHOLDER<|>FINANCIAL SECTOR STAKEHOLDER<|>Financial sector stakeholders include entities such as authorized institutions, regulatory authorities, and other participants in the financial system who have an interest in effective risk management and supervision.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>RISK-BASED SUPERVISORY APPROACH<|>RISK ASSESSMENT PROCESS<|>The risk-based supervisory approach incorporates
