Key entities include the AIs themselves, their overseas units, and the comprehensive policies and procedures they establish and enforce. The relationships highlight that AIs are responsible for enforcing AML/CFT controls across all units, including overseas branches, which must maintain equivalent standards and are subject to compliance and internal audit checks. This structure underscores a governance framework aimed at consistent risk management and regulatory compliance across the entire banking group.\",\n  \"findings\": [\n    {\n      \"summary\": \"Central role of Authorized Institutions in AML/CFT governance\",\n      \"explanation\": \"Authorized Institutions (AIs) serve as the primary entities responsible for establishing and enforcing policies and procedures designed to prevent money laundering and terrorist financing. Their governance role extends across all operational units, ensuring a unified approach to compliance and risk management.
