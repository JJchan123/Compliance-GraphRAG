This risk tolerance is a fundamental component of the institution’s risk management framework and is formally set and approved by the Board of Directors. Senior management, including the Chief Risk Officer, is responsible for monitoring adherence to the approved risk appetite, ensuring that operations align with the institution’s goals. The Chief Risk Officer also reports any material breaches or adverse developments that could cause the AI to exceed its approved risk appetite. This defined risk appetite guides the development and implementation of risk management policies and procedures, enabling the institution to balance risk-taking with regulatory compliance and strategic growth.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 149, "prompt_tokens": 384, "total_tokens": 533, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
