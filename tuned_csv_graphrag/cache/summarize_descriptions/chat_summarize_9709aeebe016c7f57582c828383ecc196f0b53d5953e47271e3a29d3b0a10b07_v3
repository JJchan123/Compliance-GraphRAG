When these institutions exhibit serious deficiencies or contraventions in their AML/CFT systems, enforcement measures are imposed to address and remediate these compliance failures. Such enforcement actions require Authorized Institutions to undertake corrective measures and regularly report progress to the HKMA. The purpose of these enforcement measures is both to rectify existing AML/CFT compliance gaps and to deter future breaches. In cases of significant non-compliance, enforcement measures may escalate to prosecution for AML/CFT offences under the AMLO, underscoring the regulatory authority’s commitment to maintaining robust financial crime controls within Authorized Institutions.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 173, "prompt_tokens": 358, "total_tokens": 531, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
