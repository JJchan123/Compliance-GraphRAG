Authorized Institutions (AIs) under the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's supervisory framework may apply this simplified CDD process specifically to SOEs and their subsidiaries in such low-risk jurisdictions. This relationship reflects a targeted regulatory approach that balances risk management with operational efficiency in AML/CFT compliance.

This targeted application allows AIs to allocate compliance resources efficiently by reducing the intensity of due diligence where the risk is minimal, while maintaining adequate oversight. This approach aligns with risk-based AML/CFT frameworks promoted by the HKMA, ensuring that regulatory efforts are proportionate to the assessed risk levels of customers.

By permitting simplified CDD for SOEs in low-risk jurisdictions, the framework acknowledges the lower inherent risk posed by these entities compared to others. This differentiation supports effective risk management by focusing enhanced scrutiny on higher-risk customers and transactions, thereby optimizing supervisory resources and compliance efforts within Authorized Institutions.

This includes establishing policies to identify eligible customers, such as SOEs in low-risk jurisdictions, and ensuring that the application of simplified CDD complies with HKMA guidelines. Boards and risk committees play a critical role in overseeing these policies to maintain robust AML/CFT controls while leveraging regulatory allowances for simplified processes where appropriate.

Supervisory engagement includes reviewing AI policies, customer risk profiles, and transaction monitoring systems to detect any misuse or gaps in AML/CFT controls. This oversight helps mitigate potential vulnerabilities arising from the relaxation of due diligence requirements and ensures compliance with regulatory standards.
