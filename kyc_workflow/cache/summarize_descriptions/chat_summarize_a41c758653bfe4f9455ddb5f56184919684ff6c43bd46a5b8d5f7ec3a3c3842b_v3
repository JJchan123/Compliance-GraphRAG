To mitigate financial crime risks such as money laundering and terrorist financing, these institutions must ensure that protectors—individuals or entities holding certain powers or responsibilities within a trust—are properly identified. Authorized Institutions may implement a risk-based approach in this verification process, tailoring the extent and rigor of identity checks according to the assessed risk level associated with each protector and trust arrangement. This approach balances regulatory compliance with operational efficiency, enhancing governance and risk management within financial organizations handling trusts.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 118, "prompt_tokens": 290, "total_tokens": 408, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
