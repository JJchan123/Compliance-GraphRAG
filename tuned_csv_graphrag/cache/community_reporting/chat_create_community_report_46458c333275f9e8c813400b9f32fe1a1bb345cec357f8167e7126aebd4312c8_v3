The HKMA enforces the Supervisory Review Process to ensure that AIs maintain sufficient capital buffers aligned with their risk profiles. The Capital Adequacy Assessment System is an internal mechanism required of these AIs, prescribed under the Supervisory Review Process, to assess capital adequacy relative to assumed risks.

This framework mandates that locally incorporated Authorized Institutions (AIs) assess and maintain capital adequacy in line with their risk profiles. HKMA's enforcement ensures that AIs hold sufficient capital buffers to cover inherent risks, thereby promoting financial stability and mitigating systemic risk within the banking sector.
