It comprises two key entities: 'Planning the Supervisory Work' and 'Defining Examination Activities.' The former involves tailoring and scheduling supervisory activities based on the AI's risk profile and complexity to ensure focused and effective examination. This planning step directly leads to the latter, which specifies the scope and nature of supervisory tasks customized according to the AI’s risk profile and business complexity. The relationship between these entities reflects a structured approach to risk management and supervisory oversight within the banking sector.\",\n  \"findings\": [\n    {\n      \"summary\": \"Planning the Supervisory Work is foundational for effective risk-based supervision\",\n      \"explanation\": \"Planning the supervisory work is a critical initial step in the HKMA's risk-based supervisory methodology. It involves tailoring and scheduling supervisory activities according to the Authorized Institution's (AI) risk profile and complexity. This ensures that supervisory resources are focused effectively on areas of higher risk, enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of examinations. By customizing the supervisory plan, regulators can better identify and mitigate potential vulnerabilities within AIs, supporting robust governance and risk management frameworks [Data: Entities (39)].\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"summary\": \"Defining Examination Activities operationalizes the supervisory plan\",\n      \"explanation\": \"Following the planning phase, defining examination activities specifies the scope and nature of supervisory tasks to be performed. These activities are customized based on the AI’s risk profile and business complexity, ensuring that the examination is relevant and comprehensive.
