assessments of Authorized Institutions, applying judgment and expertise to evaluate risk management systems and assign risk management ratings under the HKMA's risk-based supervisory approach.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RISK-FOCUSED EXAMINATION<|>SUPERVISORY PROCESS<|>The risk-focused examination is a supervisory process step emphasizing evaluation of the quality and effectiveness of an Authorized Institution’s risk management systems and internal controls, resulting in the assignment of a risk management rating incorporated into the CAMEL rating.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RISK-BASED METHODOLOGY<|>SUPERVISORY PROCESS<|>The risk-based methodology is a structured six-step supervisory process used by the HKMA to customize examinations based on the size, activities, and risk profile

inherent risks identified by the HKMA—credit, market, interest rate, liquidity, operational, legal, reputation, and strategic—represent fundamental risk categories that Authorized Institutions face
