Supervisory framework. version: V.2-23.12.2022. 1.5.14 Since, however, the risk assessment process includes many judgemental considerations, it is also possible for the composite risk profile for an activity to be lowered under the same scenario of a stable or declining credit risk environment after taking into account other relevant factors. A risk profile matrix, which serves as a guide for ascertaining the composite risk profile for each significant activity and the appropriate supervisory response is set out below: 1.5.15 The final step in phase three is to develop a risk matrix summary, which shows the composite risk profile and direction of risk by each type of inherent risk across all business activities. The composite risk profile by inherent risk is arrived at by balancing the level of inherent risk with the quality of risk management systems and the direction of risk. The risk matrix summary also reflects an overall risk profile and direction of risk for the AI. 1.5.16 Phase four of the risk assessment process requires the completion of a risk assessment narrative document, which is an integral part of the entire risk-based supervisory methodology. The narrative shows the overall level of risk by inherent risk category and direction. It also analyses the business activities within each of the risk categories and evaluates qualitatively management's effectiveness in managing and controlling the risks. The document also identifies key issues that may affect the risk profile and contains details of the type and level of activity that was assessed. The risk assessment narrative is used to assist in determining the risk-focused examination scope. 1.5.17 The goal of the risk assessment narrative is to develop an overall risk profile of an AI and provide the background to how the overall risk profile for the AI has been derived. The narrative should include a discussion of the AI's key risks, describe and assess how the AI manages the risks, detail the level and trend of the risks, document the areas of supervisory concern and provide an overall assessment of the organisation.)\n\n<|COMPLETE|>", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 557, "prompt_tokens": 1568, "total_tokens": 2125, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 1152, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
