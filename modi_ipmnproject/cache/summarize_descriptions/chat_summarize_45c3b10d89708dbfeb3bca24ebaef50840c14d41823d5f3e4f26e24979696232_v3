This process involves simulation techniques that evaluate how an AI's financial position would be impacted under such challenging scenarios. By identifying vulnerabilities within the financial framework, STRESS-TESTING aids in the development of effective contingency plans and enhances the overall risk management strategy of the AI. Through this rigorous evaluation, organizations can ensure that their AI systems are better prepared to withstand economic shocks, thereby promoting compliance with regulatory standards and fostering greater financial stability.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 121, "prompt_tokens": 284, "total_tokens": 405, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
