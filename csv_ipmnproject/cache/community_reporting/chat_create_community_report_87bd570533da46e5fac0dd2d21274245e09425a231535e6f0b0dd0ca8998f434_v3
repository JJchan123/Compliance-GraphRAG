These risks encompass credit, market, interest rate, liquidity, operational, reputation, legal, and strategic risks, which AIs must assess and manage to ensure compliance with regulatory standards. The HKMA emphasizes the importance of these risks during the supervisory process, highlighting their critical role in maintaining financial stability.
