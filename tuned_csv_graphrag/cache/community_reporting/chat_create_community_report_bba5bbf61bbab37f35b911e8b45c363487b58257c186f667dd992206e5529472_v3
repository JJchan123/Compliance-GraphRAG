Key entities include the eight categories of inherent risks faced by AIs, the risk management systems implemented to mitigate these risks, and the governance bodies such as Boards of Directors and management oversight functions responsible for maintaining effective controls. The HKMA supervisory framework integrates assessments of inherent risks at the business activity level, composite risk profiles aggregating these assessments with risk management quality, and supervisory responses tailored accordingly. Case officers play a pivotal role in evaluating risk levels, while policies and procedures underpin the operationalization of risk controls. The relationships among these entities form a comprehensive ecosystem ensuring robust financial compliance, risk mitigation, and regulatory oversight within the banking sector.\",\n  \"findings\": [\n    {\n      \"summary\": \"Eight Inherent Risks Define the Risk Landscape for Authorized Institutions\",\n      \"explanation\": \"The HKMA identifies eight fundamental inherent risks that Authorized Institutions must continuously assess and manage: credit risk, market risk, interest rate risk, liquidity risk, operational risk, legal risk, reputation risk, and strategic risk. These risks represent the core vulnerabilities that AIs face in their business operations. Effective governance requires that these risks be monitored and mitigated through comprehensive risk management systems to maintain organizational resilience and regulatory compliance. This categorization provides a structured framework for both internal risk assessment and supervisory evaluation [Data: Entities (36)].\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"summary\": \"Risk Management Systems Serve as the Foundation for Risk Control and Governance\",\n      \"explanation\": \"Risk management systems within AIs consist of policies, procedures, controls, processes, and organizational structures designed to identify, assess, measure, monitor, and control inherent risks. The HKMA evaluates these systems during on-site examinations and prudential meetings, rating them as strong, acceptable, or weak based on criteria such as management oversight, risk measurement, internal controls, and policy adequacy. These systems are critical for aligning risk mitigation efforts with regulatory expectations and the institution’s risk appetite, thereby underpinning effective governance and risk mitigation in the financial sector [Data: Entities (11); Relationships (16, 117, 118)].\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"summary\": \"Governance Structures, Including Boards and Management Oversight, Are Central to Risk Management\",\n      \"explanation\": \"The Board of Directors holds the ultimate responsibility for overseeing the establishment and maintenance of risk management systems to control risk exposures. Management oversight is a critical component within these systems, ensuring that risk controls are effectively implemented and monitored. The interaction between governance bodies and risk management systems ensures accountability and continuous improvement in risk mitigation practices within AIs [Data: Relationships (16, 117)].\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"summary\": \"Business Activities Are Individually Assessed for Inherent Risk Levels\",\n      \"explanation\": \"Each significant business activity conducted by an Authorized Institution—such as lending, trading, or treasury operations—is evaluated for its inherent risk level. This granular assessment allows for targeted risk management and supervisory focus. The inherent risk is assessed without considering existing controls, focusing on the probability and impact of potential losses arising from adverse events related to each activity [Data: Entities (76, 60); Relationships (115)].\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"summary\": \"Case Officers Play a Key Role in Risk Assessment and Judgment\",\n      \"explanation\": \"Designated HKMA supervisory staff, known as case officers, are responsible for assessing the risk profile of Authorized Institutions. They make judgment calls on the level of inherent risk—categorized as high, moderate, or low—for each functional business activity. Their assessments inform the composite risk profile and subsequent supervisory actions, making their role critical in the supervisory framework [Data: Entities (66, 60); Relationships (108)].\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"summary\": \"Composite Risk Profile Integrates Inherent Risk and Risk Management Quality\",\n      \"explanation\": \"The Composite Risk Profile is an aggregated risk assessment tool used by the HKMA to evaluate each significant business activity within an AI. It synthesizes inherent risk levels with the adequacy of the institution’s risk management systems, reflecting a balanced judgment of risk exposure and control effectiveness. The profile is categorized into low, moderate, or high levels and considers the direction of risk trends (increasing, stable, or decreasing), providing a forward-looking perspective on risk [Data: Entities (70); Relationships (122)].\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"summary\": \"Supervisory Response Is Tailored Based on Composite Risk Profiles\",\n      \"explanation\": \"The HKMA’s supervisory response comprises actions and measures designed to address identified risks and ensure the safety and soundness of Authorized Institutions. These responses are guided by the composite risk profile, with higher risk profiles triggering more intensive supervisory engagement.
