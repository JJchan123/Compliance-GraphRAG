This statement serves to define the motivations behind the AI's decisions to either take on or avoid certain types of risks. It is a crucial component in guiding the AI's actions and strategies, ensuring that they align with the organization's objectives.\n\nThe risk appetite statement is developed based on recommendations from senior management and requires approval from the Board. This approval process underscores the importance of aligning the AI's risk-taking behavior with the organization's broader goals and governance framework. By clearly outlining the level of risk that the AI is willing to accept, the statement provides a structured approach to risk management, enabling the organization to pursue its objectives while maintaining an acceptable level of risk exposure.\n\nIn summary, the risk appetite statement is essential for articulating the AI's risk-taking philosophy, ensuring that its actions are consistent with the organization's strategic aims and risk management policies.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 199, "prompt_tokens": 241, "total_tokens": 440, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
