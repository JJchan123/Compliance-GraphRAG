Key entities include various types of inherent risks such as reputation, interest rate, and operational risks, all of which are interconnected through a comprehensive risk management system designed to ensure compliance and stability within financial institutions.\",\n    \"findings\": [\n        {\n            \"summary\": \"Inherent Risks as Core Components\",\n            \"explanation\": \"Inherent risks, including credit, market, interest rate, liquidity, operational, legal, reputation, and strategic risks, are fundamental to the regulatory framework established by the HKMA. These risks must be assessed during the supervisory process to ensure that Authorized Institutions (AIs) maintain compliance with regulatory standards. The identification and management of these risks are crucial for the stability of the financial system, as they directly impact the operational integrity and financial health of AIs.

Negative public opinion can lead to a decline in customer trust, costly litigation, and ultimately, revenue losses. Effective management of reputation risk is essential for sustaining customer attraction and retention, making it a critical component of the risk appetite framework as outlined by the HKMA. Institutions must implement comprehensive policies to mitigate this risk.

Fluctuations in interest rates can adversely affect financial conditions, necessitating the implementation of robust risk management strategies. AIs are required to assess various components of interest rate risk, including repricing risk and yield curve risk, to mitigate potential negative impacts.

This risk is critical for AIs as it can significantly affect their operations and financial condition. The HKMA mandates that AIs address operational risk within their risk management frameworks to ensure compliance with regulatory standards.
