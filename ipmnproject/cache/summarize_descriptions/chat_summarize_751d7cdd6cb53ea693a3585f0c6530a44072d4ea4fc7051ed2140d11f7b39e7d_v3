These institutions are required to effectively manage credit risk as part of their broader risk management obligations. Credit risk arises when an AI is involved in business activities that include interactions with borrowers, exposing it to potential losses if these borrowers fail to meet their financial obligations. \n\nIn this context, the AI must implement robust strategies and systems to assess and mitigate credit risk, ensuring that it can adequately evaluate the creditworthiness of borrowers and manage the associated risks effectively. This involves analyzing various factors that influence a borrower's ability to repay loans, such as credit history, income levels, and economic conditions. By doing so, the AI can help authorized institutions make informed lending decisions and maintain financial stability. \n\nOverall, the integration of AI in credit risk management enhances the ability of institutions to navigate the complexities of borrower interactions and safeguard against potential financial losses.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 192, "prompt_tokens": 174, "total_tokens": 366, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
