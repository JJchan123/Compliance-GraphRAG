Intermediaries include regulated financial institutions and licensed professionals such as lawyers, auditors, accountants, trust companies, and chartered secretaries, both within Hong Kong and equivalent jurisdictions. These intermediaries implement systems to verify customer identity and must meet fit and proper criteria, including mandatory professional registration and compliance with regulatory bodies such as the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) and the Office of the Commissioner of Insurance (OCI). The relationships highlight the critical role intermediaries play in supporting AIs' compliance with AML/CFT requirements while AIs retain ultimate responsibility for customer verification and risk management.\",\n  \"findings\": [\n    {\n      \"summary\": \"Intermediaries as essential agents in customer due diligence\",\n      \"explanation\": \"Intermediaries serve as key entities engaged by Authorized Institutions to perform customer due diligence, particularly in verifying customer identity and background.

Their role is critical in ensuring compliance with regulatory requirements and mitigating risks related to money laundering and terrorist financing.
