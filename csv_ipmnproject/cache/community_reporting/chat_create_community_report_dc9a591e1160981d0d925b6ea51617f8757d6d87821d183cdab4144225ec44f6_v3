This risk requires careful assessment and management to ensure compliance with regulatory standards set by the HKMA. AIs must establish risk limits and consider interest rate risk when introducing new products or services. The assessment includes components such as repricing risk, basis risk, options risk, and yield curve risk, all essential for maintaining financial stability.
