The HKMA expects AIs to maintain a robust internal audit function that provides independent assurance on the effectiveness of their risk management frameworks. When the internal audit function meets the HKMA’s established standards, the Authority evaluates it favorably and may place greater reliance on its work. This increased reliance can lead to a reduction in the scope of the HKMA’s on-site examinations, thereby streamlining supervisory efforts. Overall, the internal audit function serves as a critical component in the HKMA’s regulatory framework to ensure sound governance and effective risk management within financial institutions under its supervision.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 137, "prompt_tokens": 297, "total_tokens": 434, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
