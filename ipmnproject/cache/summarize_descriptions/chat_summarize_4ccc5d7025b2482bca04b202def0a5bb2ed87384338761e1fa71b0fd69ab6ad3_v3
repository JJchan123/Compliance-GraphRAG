It encompasses the risk that an Authorized Institution (AI) may be unable to fulfill its financial obligations as they become due, which can arise from various factors, including funding challenges or market liquidity issues. This risk is characterized by an imbalance between an entity's liquid assets and its liabilities, potentially leading to difficulties in meeting short-term financial commitments.\n\nMoreover, liquidity risk also pertains to the potential challenges associated with buying or selling assets without causing substantial fluctuations in their prices. Such price impacts can be exacerbated by changes in market conditions, which further complicate the ability of financial institutions to manage their liquidity effectively. Overall, liquidity risk represents a critical aspect of financial stability, as it directly affects an institution's capacity to operate smoothly and meet its obligations in a timely manner.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 174, "prompt_tokens": 278, "total_tokens": 452, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
