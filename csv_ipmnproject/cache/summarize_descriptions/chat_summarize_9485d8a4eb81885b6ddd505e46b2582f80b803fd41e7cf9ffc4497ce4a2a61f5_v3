These risks are particularly relevant to financial institutions, as they can be exploited to facilitate illicit financial transactions. The assessment of these risks is a critical component of supervisory examinations conducted by regulatory bodies, such as the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA). The HKMA evaluates the ML/TF risks that authorized institutions (AIs) encounter, ensuring that they implement appropriate measures to effectively mitigate these risks and comply with regulatory standards.
