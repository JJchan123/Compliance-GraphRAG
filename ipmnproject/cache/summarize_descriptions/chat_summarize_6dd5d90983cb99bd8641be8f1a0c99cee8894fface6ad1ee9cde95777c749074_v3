It encompasses various risks that may arise from operational, financial, strategic, or compliance-related activities. The management of risk exposure is a critical function within organizations, and it is typically overseen by the Chief Risk Officer (CRO), who is responsible for monitoring and reporting on these risks.\n\nIn the context of artificial intelligence (AI), risk exposure also includes the potential for adverse effects that may result from inadequately managed risks. This highlights the importance of implementing robust risk management practices, particularly as organizations increasingly rely on AI technologies.
