This characteristic poses a higher risk of anonymity and potential misuse, as ownership can be transferred simply by delivering the certificate without any formal record of the transaction. Due to these risks, Authorized Institutions are required to closely monitor principal shareholders holding bearer shares. Where practical, these institutions should immobilize bearer shares to prevent unauthorized transfers and enhance transparency. If immobilization is not feasible, Authorized Institutions must obtain declarations from beneficial owners disclosing their shareholding percentages to ensure proper identification and compliance with regulatory frameworks aimed at mitigating risks related to money laundering, fraud, and other illicit activities.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 140, "prompt_tokens": 312, "total_tokens": 452, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
