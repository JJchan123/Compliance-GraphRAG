This risk is significant as it can lead to a decline in customer base, costly litigation, and revenue reductions. AIs must incorporate reputation risk into their risk management reporting and strategies to maintain trust and stability among stakeholders. It is one of the eight inherent risks identified by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA), which AIs are required to manage effectively. Addressing reputation risk is critical, especially when introducing new products or services, as it directly impacts an AI's ability to attract and retain customers.
