It refers to the potential loss arising from damage to an AI’s reputation, which can adversely affect its ability to maintain existing business relationships or establish new ones. This risk encompasses negative publicity—whether accurate or not—that may lead to a decline in the customer base, costly litigation, reduced revenue, and diminished stakeholder confidence. Due to its qualitative and less quantifiable nature, reputation risk is addressed through qualitative statements, monitoring indicators, and proactive management within the firm-wide risk management framework. Market rumors and public perceptions are significant factors influencing this risk, making it a material concern that must be continuously assessed and managed as part of the institution’s overall risk appetite and governance policies.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 168, "prompt_tokens": 679, "total_tokens": 847, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
