It refers to the risk that an AI will be unable to meet its financial obligations as they fall due without incurring unacceptable losses. This risk encompasses two main components: funding liquidity risk, where the AI cannot liquidate assets or obtain necessary funding, and market liquidity risk, where the AI cannot easily unwind or offset exposures without significantly lowering market prices due to inadequate market depth or market disruptions. Effective management of liquidity risk involves implementing risk limits and robust risk management procedures to ensure that the AI can fulfill its financial commitments in a timely manner while minimizing potential losses.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 140, "prompt_tokens": 596, "total_tokens": 736, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
