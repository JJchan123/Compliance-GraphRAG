These activities include money laundering, terrorist financing, fraud, corruption, and the financing of proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. Such crimes pose significant risks to economic and financial systems globally and require robust prevention, detection, and mitigation efforts.\n\nAuthorized Institutions, particularly within the banking sector, are mandated to implement comprehensive risk management and compliance frameworks to guard against these illicit activities. These frameworks are guided by Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT) systems, which are designed to identify, prevent, and respond to financial crime risks effectively.\n\nRegulatory authorities, including the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA), play a critical supervisory role in enforcing AML/CFT policies and ensuring that financial institutions adhere to stringent controls. Through ongoing supervision and enforcement, these authorities aim to uphold the integrity of the financial system by minimizing vulnerabilities to financial crime and maintaining robust governance and risk management practices within Authorized Institutions.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 205, "prompt_tokens": 504, "total_tokens": 709, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
