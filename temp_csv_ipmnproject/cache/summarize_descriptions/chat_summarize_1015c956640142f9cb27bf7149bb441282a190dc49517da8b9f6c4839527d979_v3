It arises from inadequate or failed internal processes, people, systems, or external events that may cause direct or indirect loss or disrupt the operations of authorized institutions (AIs). The evaluation of operational risk considers various factors, including product-specific elements such as market maturity, fund movements, segregation of duties, and market complexity, as well as AI-specific factors like audit quality, transaction volume, system capacity, processing complexity, and the extent of manual intervention. This risk is incorporated into the AI’s overall risk profile and is actively managed through risk management reporting and controls to ensure regulatory compliance and operational resilience.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 140, "prompt_tokens": 643, "total_tokens": 783, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
