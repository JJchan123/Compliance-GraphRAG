Key entities include the Risk Assessment Process, the Eight Inherent Risks identified by the HKMA, the Risk Profile Matrix, and considerations of New Risk Types. The Risk Assessment Process evaluates the Eight Inherent Risks—credit, market, interest rate, liquidity, operational, legal, reputation, and strategic risks—across different business activities within AIs. The Risk Profile Matrix then synthesizes these assessments to determine composite risk profiles for significant activities, guiding supervisory responses. Additionally, emerging New Risk Types are integrated into the evaluation of inherent risks to capture evolving threats. These entities and their relationships form a structured ecosystem that supports effective governance, risk management, and regulatory compliance within the banking sector under HKMA oversight.\",\n  \"findings\": [\n    {\n      \"summary\": \"The Risk Assessment Process systematically evaluates the Eight Inherent Risks by business activity within Authorized Institutions.\",\n      \"explanation\": \"The Risk Assessment Process is a critical component in the HKMA's supervisory framework, designed to evaluate each of the Eight Inherent Risks—credit, market, interest rate, liquidity, operational, legal, reputation, and strategic risks—specifically by business activity within an AI. This granular approach allows institutions to understand the level, direction, and impact of each risk category on different operational areas, facilitating targeted risk management and compliance efforts. By assessing both the magnitude and trajectory of these risks, the process supports comprehensive governance and informed decision-making, ensuring that AIs maintain robust controls aligned with regulatory expectations [Data: Entities (56, 59), Relationships (82)].\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"summary\": \"The Risk Profile Matrix integrates risk assessments to determine composite risk profiles for significant activities within Authorized Institutions.\",\n      \"explanation\": \"The Risk Profile Matrix serves as a guiding tool that consolidates the outcomes of the risk assessment process to establish a composite risk profile for each significant activity of an AI. This matrix balances the inherent risk levels against the quality of risk management, thereby informing the HKMA's supervisory response.
