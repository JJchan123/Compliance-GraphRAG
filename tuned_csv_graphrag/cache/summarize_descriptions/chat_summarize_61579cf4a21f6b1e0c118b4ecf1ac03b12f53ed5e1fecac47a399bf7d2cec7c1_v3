It encompasses a detailed summary of the types, levels, and directions of risks faced by the AI, derived from thorough risk assessment exercises. This profile captures all eight categories of inherent risks relevant to the institution, providing a holistic view of its risk landscape. The primary purpose of the Risk Profile is to guide supervisory planning, examination activities, and resource allocation, ensuring that supervisory efforts are effectively tailored to the AI’s specific risk exposures.
