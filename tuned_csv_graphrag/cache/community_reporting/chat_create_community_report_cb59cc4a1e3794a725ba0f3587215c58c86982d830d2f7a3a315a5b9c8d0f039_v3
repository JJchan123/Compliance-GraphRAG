Central to the ecosystem are Management and the Board of Directors, which oversee internal controls, segregation of duties, and information sharing. Control functions operate with independence, supported by clear reporting lines and official lines of authority, to monitor compliance and risk. Segregation of duties is rigorously implemented across operational areas such as trading, custodial, back-office, loan origination, marketing, and processing to mitigate conflicts of interest and operational risks. Compliance advice letters from the HKMA serve as enforcement tools to prompt remediation of AML/CFT weaknesses.
