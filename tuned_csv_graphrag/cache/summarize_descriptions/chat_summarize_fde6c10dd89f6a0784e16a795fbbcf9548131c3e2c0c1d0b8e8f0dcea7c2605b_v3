It is designed to enable targeted support and the efficient allocation of resources to effectively address money laundering (ML) and terrorist financing (TF) risks within the banking sector. The RBA is adopted by Authorized Institutions to differentiate risks among customers and transactions, applying proportional and appropriate AML/CFT measures based on assessed risk levels. This ensures that compliance efforts are focused on higher-risk areas, thereby mitigating financial crime risks effectively while avoiding undue regulatory burden or financial exclusion. Furthermore, the RBA serves as a supervisory methodology employed by both the Government and the HKMA to tailor compliance obligations in accordance with the ML/TF risk profiles of businesses and individuals, optimizing governance and risk management across the financial sector.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 182, "prompt_tokens": 377, "total_tokens": 559, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
