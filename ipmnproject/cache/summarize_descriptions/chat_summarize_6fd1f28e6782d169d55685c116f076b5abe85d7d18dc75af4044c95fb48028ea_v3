Its primary functions include establishing sound business strategies, overseeing risk management, and ensuring compliance with regulatory requirements. The Board is tasked with implementing appropriate policies and procedures to manage risks effectively within the organization.\n\nIn the context of an authorized institution, the Board of Directors plays a vital role in ensuring adherence to Anti-Money Laundering and Counter Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT) regulations as mandated by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA). This includes overseeing the institution's compliance with AML/CFT systems and ensuring that the necessary governance frameworks are in place to mitigate risks associated with financial crimes.\n\nFurthermore, the Board of Directors is ultimately accountable for the risk management system within the organization, ensuring that it aligns with the institution's strategic objectives and regulatory obligations. Each locally-incorporated bank's Board is specifically responsible for overseeing the bank's operations, ensuring that they comply with all relevant regulatory requirements, and maintaining the integrity of the institution's operations.\n\nIn summary, the Board of Directors serves as the governing authority that not only shapes the strategic vision of the institution but also ensures robust risk management and compliance with AML/CFT regulations, thereby safeguarding the institution's integrity and operational effectiveness.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 256, "prompt_tokens": 310, "total_tokens": 566, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
