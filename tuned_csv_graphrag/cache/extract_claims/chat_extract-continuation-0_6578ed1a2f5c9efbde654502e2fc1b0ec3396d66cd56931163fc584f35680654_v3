When faced with, and making decisions in response to, new business opportunities (e.g. possible business expansion or mergers and acquisitions), market demand for increased risk-taking or the need to react promptly to changes in the external environment (e.g. due to competition or deterioration in economic conditions), the Board should ensure that there is an assessment of the AI’s risk appetite in the decision-making process. In these circumstances, the Board should thoroughly understand the AI’s current risk position relative to its risk appetite, and how that position would be changed if the risk appetite were to be changed.
