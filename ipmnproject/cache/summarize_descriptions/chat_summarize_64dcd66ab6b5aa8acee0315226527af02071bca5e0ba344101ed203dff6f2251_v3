It forms a crucial part of the broader risk management process, which aims to mitigate potential threats to an organization. This evaluation is particularly important when considering new products or services, as it helps organizations understand the implications these innovations may have on their operations and overall risk profile.\n\nThe risk assessment process is not only applicable to general organizational activities but is also specifically undertaken by entities such as the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) to evaluate the risks associated with emerging technologies, including artificial intelligence (AI). This targeted approach ensures that the unique challenges and uncertainties posed by AI are thoroughly analyzed, allowing for informed decision-making and strategic planning.\n\nIn summary, risk assessment serves as a foundational element in identifying and managing risks across various contexts, ensuring that organizations can navigate potential challenges effectively while pursuing new opportunities.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 177, "prompt_tokens": 238, "total_tokens": 415, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
