This process systematically examines the risk profile of authorized institutions, including their inherent and residual risks, while also scrutinizing the effectiveness and robustness of their risk management systems. By doing so, it ensures that authorized institutions maintain adequate controls and governance structures to manage potential financial, operational, compliance, and strategic risks. The insights derived from the risk assessment process support regulatory oversight and help authorized institutions enhance their risk mitigation strategies, thereby promoting sound financial stability and compliance within the regulatory framework.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 130, "prompt_tokens": 289, "total_tokens": 419, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
