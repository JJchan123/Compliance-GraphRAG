This risk is a critical component of the risk management systems employed by AIs and is one of the eight inherent risks that the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) mandates these institutions to assess and manage. The evaluation of credit risk involves analyzing the probability of default and understanding the financial implications for the institution in the event of such a default. As AIs introduce new products or services, credit risk remains a significant concern, necessitating thorough assessment and management within their risk management frameworks. Overall, credit risk is a key focus area for AIs, highlighting the importance of robust risk management practices to mitigate potential losses associated with borrower defaults.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 163, "prompt_tokens": 573, "total_tokens": 736, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
