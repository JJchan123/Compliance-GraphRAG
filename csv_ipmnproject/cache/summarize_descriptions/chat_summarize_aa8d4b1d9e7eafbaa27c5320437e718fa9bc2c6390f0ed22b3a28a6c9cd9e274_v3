This approach ensures that risk management is an integral part of performance assessments, allowing for a more nuanced understanding of how risks impact overall outcomes. Additionally, it encompasses a system designed to measure the performance of various business units within AIs on a risk-adjusted basis, thereby ensuring that financial performance evaluations adequately account for the risks undertaken.
