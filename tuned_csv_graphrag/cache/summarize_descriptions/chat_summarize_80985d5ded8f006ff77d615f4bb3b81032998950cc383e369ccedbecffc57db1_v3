This process is an integral part of the AI’s risk management framework and involves multiple layers of oversight, including participation from senior management, the Board or its Risk Committee, and key risk management functions such as the Chief Risk Officer and internal control units.\n\nThe process ensures that all associated risks—including financial, operational, compliance, and specifically Anti-Money Laundering and Counter Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT) risks—are properly identified, measured, assessed, and managed before any new product or service is introduced to the market. It incorporates detailed risk assessments, cost-benefit analyses, and resource evaluations, alongside procedures for ongoing risk measurement, monitoring, control, mitigation, and reporting.\n\nFurthermore, the New Product Approval Process mandates regular reviews by the internal audit function to verify its effectiveness and compliance with regulatory and internal policies. The Board or Risk Committee also reviews new initiatives to confirm the adequacy of the AI’s risk management capabilities, setting clear timeframes for any necessary system upgrades or adjustments. Overall, this process ensures robust governance and risk management, safeguarding the institution against potential risks arising from new business activities.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 271, "prompt_tokens": 859, "total_tokens": 1130, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
