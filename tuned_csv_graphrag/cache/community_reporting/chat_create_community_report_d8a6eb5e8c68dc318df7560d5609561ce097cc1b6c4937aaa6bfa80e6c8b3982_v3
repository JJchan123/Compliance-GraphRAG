Central to this ecosystem are the Authorized Institutions (AIs), which implement AML/CFT systems and report suspicious transactions to the Joint Financial Intelligence Unit (JFIU). The JFIU acts as a pivotal intermediary, collaborating closely with the HKMA and multiple law enforcement agencies—including the Hong Kong Police Force, Customs and Excise Department, and Independent Commission Against Corruption—to analyze financial intelligence and support investigations. Oversight and policy coordination are led by the Central Coordinating Committee on AML/CFT (CCC), chaired by the Financial Secretary, who also plays a critical governance role in inquiries and enforcement actions concerning AIs. Additional collaborative bodies such as the Fraud and Money Laundering Intelligence Taskforce, involving the HKMA, law enforcement, and industry representatives like the Hong Kong Association of Banks, further enhance intelligence sharing and risk mitigation.
