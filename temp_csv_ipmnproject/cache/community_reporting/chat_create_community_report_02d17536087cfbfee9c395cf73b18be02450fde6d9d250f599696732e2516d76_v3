The Board serves as the highest governing body, overseeing firm-wide risk management, including approval of key policies such as the New Product Approval Policy and ensuring compliance with corporate governance and regulatory requirements like the Banking (Capital) Ordinance. The Board delegates authority to internal control functions and independent risk management teams responsible for monitoring and controlling risks. Contingency plans are integrated into the risk management system based on stress testing and risk assessments. Information systems and infrastructure support these risk management and reporting needs.
