Key entities include the Risk Reporting function, the Risk Management Information System (RMIS), and the Risk Data Aggregation and Risk Reporting Framework. The RMIS is established and maintained by AIs to capture, aggregate, and report risk data across various organizational levels, including entity and group levels. The system operates with sufficient technological support to ensure reliability even during stress periods and incorporates exception alerts to notify senior management of any data capture or reporting issues. These components collectively support compliance with regulatory standards and facilitate effective risk oversight by providing timely and comprehensive risk information to stakeholders such as the HKMA, senior management, and the Board.\",\n  \"findings\": [\n    {\n      \"summary\": \"Risk Reporting is a critical communication process for regulatory compliance\",\n      \"explanation\": \"Risk Reporting serves as the systematic process through which risk data, analysis, and related information are communicated to key stakeholders, including the Board, senior management, and regulatory bodies like the HKMA. This process ensures that decision-makers are well-informed about risk exposures, risk limit usage, and the overall risk profile, enabling effective risk oversight and compliance with regulatory standards. The direct relationship between Risk Reporting and the HKMA highlights its essential role in fulfilling supervisory requirements and maintaining regulatory adherence [Data: Entities (349); Relationships (803)].\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"summary\": \"Risk Management Information System (RMIS) is foundational for effective risk data handling\",\n      \"explanation\": \"The RMIS is an integrated technological platform that Authorized Institutions are responsible for establishing and maintaining. It captures, aggregates, and reports risks associated with major business activities, supporting the risk management function in monitoring and managing the institution's overall risk profile. The system's design includes sufficient processing capacity to operate reliably during stress periods, ensuring continuous and accurate risk data reporting across multiple dimensions such as business line, product, portfolio, function, and organizational levels. This comprehensive capability facilitates informed decision-making and adherence to regulatory standards [Data: Entities (343); Relationships (791)].\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"summary\": \"Risk Data Aggregation and Risk Reporting Framework governs risk data processes\",\n      \"explanation\": \"Within an Authorized Institution, the Risk Data Aggregation and Risk Reporting Framework provides a structured governance mechanism for collecting, consolidating, and communicating risk data. The RMIS operates within this framework to ensure that risk data capture, aggregation, and reporting are conducted systematically and in compliance with regulatory requirements. This framework supports the institution's ability to manage risks effectively and maintain transparency with regulators and internal stakeholders [Data: Entities (358); Relationships (794)].\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"summary\": \"Exception Alerts enhance risk data integrity and management oversight\",\n      \"explanation\": \"Exception Alerts are processes embedded within the RMIS that identify and notify senior management of any exceptions, incompleteness, or weaknesses in risk data capture and reporting. These alerts are crucial for maintaining the integrity and reliability of risk information, enabling timely corrective actions and strengthening the institution's risk management capabilities.

This multi-level reporting enables comprehensive risk assessment and management across the institution, facilitating a holistic view of risk exposures and supporting regulatory compliance. The aggregation of risk data at these levels ensures that both granular and consolidated risk information is available for decision-making and supervisory review [Data: Entities (361, 362); Relationships (804, 805)].\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"summary\": \"Risk management policies and procedures are informed by business activities\",\n      \"explanation\": \"Risk management policies and procedures within Authorized Institutions are developed based on a comprehensive review of all business activities to manage associated strategic risks effectively.
