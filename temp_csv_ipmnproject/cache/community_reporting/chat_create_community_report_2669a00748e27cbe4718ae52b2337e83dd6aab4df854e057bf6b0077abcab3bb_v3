These entities operate within a comprehensive risk-based supervisory framework designed to ensure their safety, soundness, and compliance with regulatory standards, particularly concerning Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT) policies. The HKMA conducts risk profiling exercises and supervisory oversight, including on-site examinations and enforcement actions, to assess and manage inherent and emerging risks such as credit, market, operational, legal, and reputational risks. The relationships among entities include the HKMA's issuance of guidance papers, oversight of remedial actions, and collaboration with independent external advisers. The community also encompasses various risk factors, supervisory tools like the CAMEL rating system, and operational components such as business lines, IT systems, and management information systems within Authorized Institutions.
