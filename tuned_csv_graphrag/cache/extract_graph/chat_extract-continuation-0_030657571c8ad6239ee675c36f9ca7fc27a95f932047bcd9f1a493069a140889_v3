These include inherent risks arising from the AI’s business activities or new products or services to be launched.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RISK APPETITE FRAMEWORK<|>RISK APPETITE FRAMEWORK<|>The risk appetite framework defines the level and types of risk the AI is willing to accept in pursuit of its business objectives. It guides the setting of risk limits and the overall risk management strategy, ensuring alignment with the AI’s business goals and risk capacity.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RISK LIMIT<|>RISK LIMIT<|>Risk Limits are specific thresholds or boundaries set within the risk management framework and policies, designed to keep the AI’s risk exposures within the overall risk appetite. Senior management is responsible for ensuring risk exposures remain within these limits, including under stressed conditions.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RISK MANAGEMENT POLICY<|>RISK MANAGEMENT POLICY<|>Risk Management Policy comprises the detailed policies, procedures, and limits formulated by senior management to manage different aspects of risk arising from the AI’s business activities. These policies are based on the risk management strategies laid down by the Board and form part of the overall risk management framework.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RISK GOVERNANCE<|>RISK GOVERNANCE<|>Risk Governance refers to the organizational structures, roles, responsibilities, and processes established to oversee and manage risk within the AI.
