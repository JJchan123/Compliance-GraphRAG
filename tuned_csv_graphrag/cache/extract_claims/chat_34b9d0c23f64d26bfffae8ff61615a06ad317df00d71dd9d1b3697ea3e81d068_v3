The Board should approve the policy and should oversee the implementation of the policy by senior management (with the assistance of the compliance function) through regular review of the extent to which the policy is observed. The Board may designate an appropriate Board-level committee to review and approve the compliance policy and conduct regular reviews of how the policy is being implemented. In such a case, the designated committee (e.g. the Audit Committee) should have the required independence to take up the mandate. The Board should monitor the committee’s performance to ensure that its directives are properly followed.15)\n<|COMPLETE|>", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 603, "prompt_tokens": 1446, "total_tokens": 2049, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 1024, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
