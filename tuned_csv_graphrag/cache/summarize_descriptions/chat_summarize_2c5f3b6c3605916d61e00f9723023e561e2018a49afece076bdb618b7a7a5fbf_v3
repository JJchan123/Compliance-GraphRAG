The HKMA sets comprehensive requirements and supervisory expectations for AIs’ risk management systems, focusing on inherent risk assessment, prudential risk management, and robust compliance frameworks.\n\nThrough a risk-based supervisory approach, the HKMA conducts continuous oversight involving risk-focused on-site examinations, prudential meetings, and engagement with boards of directors. It gathers detailed information on AIs’ business activities and risk management practices to evaluate their composite risk profiles and ensure effective governance. The HKMA requires timely notification of key compliance appointments and mandates submission of comprehensive remedial action plans and regular status reports to address identified AML/CFT deficiencies.\n\nThe HKMA enforces compliance with AML/CFT regulations under the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing Ordinance (AMLO) by overseeing the implementation of AML/CFT policies, suspicious transaction reporting, and risk mitigation measures related to money laundering, terrorist financing, and international sanctions. It exercises statutory powers to impose supervisory and enforcement actions, including revoking or suspending authorizations and imposing conditions on AIs when deficiencies or non-compliance are detected.\n\nOverall, the HKMA’s supervisory framework ensures that Authorized Institutions maintain effective risk management and compliance systems to mitigate financial crime risks, uphold prudential standards, and protect depositors, thereby promoting the stability and integrity of Hong Kong’s banking sector.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 329, "prompt_tokens": 1132, "total_tokens": 1461, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
