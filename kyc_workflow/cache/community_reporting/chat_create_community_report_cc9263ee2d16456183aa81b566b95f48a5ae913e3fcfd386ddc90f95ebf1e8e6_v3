Key entities include the correspondent banking relationships themselves, the formal delegation of authority within AIs, and the structured approval processes for new correspondent banking relationships. These entities are interconnected through processes that emphasize risk-based approaches, formal governance, and compliance with anti-money laundering and counter-financing of terrorism (AML/CFT) policies. The relationships highlight the critical role of senior management in approving new correspondent banking relationships, ensuring proper documentation, and embedding these activities within the institution's broader risk management framework.\",\n  \"findings\": [\n    {\n      \"summary\": \"Correspondent banking relationships require robust risk management frameworks.\",\n      \"explanation\": \"Correspondent banking involves one bank providing services to another, which inherently carries risks such as money laundering and the use of shell banks. The community analysis reveals that these relationships are governed by comprehensive risk management frameworks that mandate risk-based approval processes and continuous monitoring. This ensures that risks are identified, assessed, and mitigated effectively to maintain regulatory compliance and safeguard the financial system's integrity.

This delegation is documented and empowers specific individuals or committees to approve and manage these relationships. Such formalization ensures clear accountability and governance, preventing unauthorized or high-risk relationships from being established without proper oversight.
