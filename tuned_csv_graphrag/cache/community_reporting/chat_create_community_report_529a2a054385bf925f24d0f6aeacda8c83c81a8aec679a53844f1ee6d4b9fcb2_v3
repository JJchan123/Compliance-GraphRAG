These functions operate under the governance of formal Risk Policies, which are further detailed and operationalized through Risk Guidelines. The relationships indicate a structured hierarchy where risk policies govern the credit-related functions, ensuring consistent risk-taking aligned with the AI's business activities and financial strength.\",\n  \"findings\": [\n    {\n      \"summary\": \"Credit Approval Function operates under established Risk Policies\",\n      \"explanation\": \"The Credit Approval Function is a critical component within the lending area of an AI, staffed by qualified personnel responsible for approving credit exposures. This function operates directly under the Risk Policies established by the AI, ensuring that credit approvals are consistent with the institution's risk appetite and regulatory requirements. This alignment is essential for maintaining effective credit risk controls and compliance with supervisory expectations [Data: Entities (386, 389); Relationships (843)].\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"summary\": \"Credit Review Function ensures ongoing compliance with Risk Policies and Guidelines\",\n      \"explanation\": \"The Credit Review Function is responsible for the continuous monitoring and review of credit exposures and problem credits.
