This risk is critical in the context of financial compliance, as it directly impacts the risk management systems that AIs must implement to adhere to regulatory standards set by the HKMA. The evaluation of credit risk involves assessing the probability of default and its financial implications, making it a key focus area for compliance efforts. AIs must develop robust strategies to mitigate potential losses associated with credit risk to maintain regulatory compliance and ensure financial stability.
