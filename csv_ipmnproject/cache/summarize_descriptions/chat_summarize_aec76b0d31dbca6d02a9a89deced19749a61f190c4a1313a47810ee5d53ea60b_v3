This process is essential for ensuring that risks remain within acceptable limits and for identifying any emerging risks that may affect the institution's stability. It involves the continuous review of risk exposures and management practices to ensure compliance with established risk limits and policies. \n\nRISK MONITORING encompasses the identification and measurement of all quantifiable and material risk factors, supported by robust information systems that deliver timely and accurate reports on the financial condition and risk exposure of the AIs. By monitoring both identified and residual risks, as well as recognizing new risks, RISK MONITORING plays a crucial role in facilitating effective risk management strategies and ensuring timely responses to changes in the risk environment. This holistic approach is vital for maintaining the integrity and compliance of financial institutions in a dynamic regulatory landscape.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 179, "prompt_tokens": 414, "total_tokens": 593, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
