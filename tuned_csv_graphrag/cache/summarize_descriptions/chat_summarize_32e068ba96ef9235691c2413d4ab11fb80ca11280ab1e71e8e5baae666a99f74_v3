It is designed to be proportionate to the AI’s size, nature, and complexity, ensuring that risk management practices align with the institution’s risk appetite and business objectives. The framework encompasses a wide range of components, including policies, procedures, control systems, governance structures, and risk limits, all approved by senior management and the Board.\n\nKey elements of the Risk Management Framework include centralized or regional risk management functions that comply with local regulatory standards, risk governance arrangements such as oversight by the Risk Committee and senior management, and integration with the institution’s risk appetite framework. It incorporates risk measurement methodologies, including stress testing, limit setting, capital allocation, and regular back-testing, supported by expert judgment to maintain accuracy and relevance.\n\nThe framework also involves internal controls, compliance functions, audits, and contingency planning to ensure ongoing effectiveness and regulatory compliance. Periodic review and assessment, often conducted by internal audit, ensure that the framework remains robust and responsive to emerging risks, including those arising from new products and services. Overall, the Risk Management Framework serves as the foundational system enabling an Authorized Institution to manage risks consistently, effectively, and in alignment with regulatory expectations and organizational goals.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 270, "prompt_tokens": 884, "total_tokens": 1154, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
