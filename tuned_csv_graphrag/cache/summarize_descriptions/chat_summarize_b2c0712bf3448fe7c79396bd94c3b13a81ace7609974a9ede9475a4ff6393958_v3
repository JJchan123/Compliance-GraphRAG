It ensures that critical responsibilities—including trading, custodial functions, back-office operations, loan origination, marketing, and processing—are adequately separated. This separation prevents conflicts of interest, reduces the risk of errors and fraud, and strengthens the institution’s overall internal control environment. By enforcing clear boundaries between these functions, segregation of duties supports effective oversight and compliance with regulatory requirements, thereby safeguarding the institution’s operational integrity and financial stability.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 110, "prompt_tokens": 338, "total_tokens": 448, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
