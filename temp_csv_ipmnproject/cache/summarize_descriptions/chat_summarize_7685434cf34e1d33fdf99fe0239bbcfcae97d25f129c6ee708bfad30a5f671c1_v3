It assesses both the independence and performance of the internal audit function to determine the appropriate scope and degree of reliance on its work during supervisory examinations. This evaluation helps the HKMA gauge the effectiveness and reliability of internal audits in identifying and addressing compliance issues. Additionally, the HKMA may mandate that AIs utilize their internal audit function to independently validate the effectiveness of remedial actions taken to rectify Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT) deficiencies. Through these measures, the HKMA ensures that the internal audit function serves as a robust mechanism for ongoing compliance monitoring and risk management within the financial sector.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 153, "prompt_tokens": 307, "total_tokens": 460, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
