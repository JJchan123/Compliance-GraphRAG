This framework encompasses the establishment, approval, and strict adherence to the AI’s risk appetite, which defines the level and types of risk the institution is willing to accept in pursuit of its objectives. A key function of the Risk Management Framework is to evaluate whether new products or services fall within the AI’s approved risk appetite, thereby ensuring that all business activities remain consistent with the institution’s risk tolerance and regulatory compliance standards. Together, the Risk Management Framework and the defined Risk Appetite operate as integral components that guide the AI’s risk-taking decisions and promote sustainable risk governance.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 150, "prompt_tokens": 286, "total_tokens": 436, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
