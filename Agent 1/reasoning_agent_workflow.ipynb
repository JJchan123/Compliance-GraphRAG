      "### Definition of Customer Due Diligence (CDD) According to HKMA\n",
      "\n",
      "Customer Due Diligence (CDD) is a comprehensive policy framework and risk management process mandated by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) for Authorized Institutions (AIs). It involves verifying the identity of customers and beneficial owners, assessing their risk profiles, and implementing measures to prevent financial crimes such as money laundering and terrorist financing. The process requires AIs to identify and verify customers through reliable means, including face-to-face interviews or trusted intermediaries, and to understand ownership structures to ensure transparency. CDD also involves ongoing monitoring of transactions to detect suspicious activities and manage risks effectively [Data: Entities (57, 78, 325); Relationships (574, 86)] (Source: g33a: SUPPLEMENT TO THE GUIDELINE ON PREVENTION OF MONEY LAUNDERING, Section 3. Customer due diligence).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Key Components of CDD\n",
      "\n",
      "The CDD process includes several critical steps:\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Identification and Verification:** AIs must identify the direct customer and verify their identity using reliable, independent documents such as passports, identity cards, or travel documents. For corporate customers, this includes identifying beneficial owners and understanding complex ownership structures [Data: Entities (78, 107); Sources (24, 5)].\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Risk Assessment:** AIs assess the money laundering and terrorist financing risks associated with each customer. Enhanced due diligence is required for higher-risk customers, especially those connected with jurisdictions that do not fully comply with the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) Recommendations or have AML/CFT deficiencies [Data: Entities (57, 40, 65); Relationships (94, 345)].\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Ongoing Monitoring:** Continuous scrutiny of transactions is necessary to ensure they are consistent with the customer's risk profile and business activities. This includes updating customer information and reviewing transactions regularly [Data: Entities (57, 78); Sources (26)].\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Documentation:** AIs must document their assessments, decisions, and justifications related to CDD to enable accountability and review by the HKMA or other relevant authorities [Data: Entities (54); Relationships (75, 84)].\n",
      "\n",
      "### Application and Regulatory Context\n",
      "\n",
      "The HKMA integrates international standards, such as those recommended by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and the FATF, into its guidelines. It requires all authorized institutions to implement robust CDD policies as a critical component of their AML/CFT systems. These policies are designed to safeguard the integrity of Hong Kong's financial system by preventing misuse of accounts and detecting illicit financial activities [Data: Entities (27, 33, 341); Relationships (337, 96)].\n",
      "\n",
      "Furthermore, the HKMA emphasizes a risk-based approach, allowing AIs to tailor the extent of due diligence based on the assessed risk level of customers and transactions. Simplified CDD procedures may be applied only to low-risk customers with proper justification and senior management approval [Data: Entities (51, 39, 83, 145); Sources (4, 39)].\n",
      "\n",
      "### Special Considerations\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Non-Face-to-Face Customers:** When face-to-face verification is not possible, AIs must apply equally effective identification and monitoring measures, such as certification of documents, additional documentation, or third-party introductions [Data: Sources (23)].\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Transactions by Non-Account Holders:** For transactions exceeding HK$120,000 by non-account holders, AIs must identify and verify the customer and any beneficial owners, understand ownership structures, and ascertain the purpose of the transaction [Data: Sources (26)].\n",
      "\n",
      "- **High-Risk Jurisdictions:** Enhanced scrutiny and countermeasures are applied for customers connected with jurisdictions that do not or insufficiently apply FATF Recommendations, including more stringent CDD and transaction monitoring [Data: Sources (20)].\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, customer due diligence according to the HKMA is a rigorous, risk-based process that requires authorized financial institutions to verify customer identities, assess risks, monitor transactions continuously, and maintain thorough documentation to prevent money laundering and terrorist financing, thereby ensuring the integrity of Hong Kong's financial system.\n",
      "\n",
