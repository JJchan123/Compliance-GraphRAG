During this phase, a risk matrix summary is developed to illustrate the composite risk profile and the direction of risk associated with each type of inherent risk. Additionally, phase three encompasses a series of steps aimed at assessing the level of inherent risk by functional activity for each of the eight inherent risks identified within the context of AIs (Artificial Intelligence systems). This comprehensive approach ensures a thorough understanding of risk dynamics, facilitating better risk management and compliance with regulatory standards.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 121, "prompt_tokens": 309, "total_tokens": 430, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
