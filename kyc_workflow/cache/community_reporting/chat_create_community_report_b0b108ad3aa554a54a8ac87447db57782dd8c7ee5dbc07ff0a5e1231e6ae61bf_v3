Key entities include AIs, regulatory authorities such as the HKMA, international bodies like the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) and the United Nations Security Council (UNSC), and legal frameworks including AML/CFT laws, regulations, and sanctions ordinances. The relationships map how AIs implement due diligence measures such as company searches and certificates of incumbency, respond to supervisory countermeasures including enhanced surveillance and reporting, and manage risks arising from jurisdictions with AML/CFT deficiencies and designated terrorist entities. The ecosystem highlights the flow of regulatory requirements from international standards through local legislation to operational compliance activities within AIs, emphasizing governance structures that address terrorist financing, money laundering, and reputational risks.\",\n  \"findings\": [\n    {\n      \"summary\": \"Authorized Institutions rely on due diligence tools like company searches and certificates of incumbency to verify corporate customers\",\n      \"explanation\": \"Authorized Institutions (AIs) use company searches and certificates of incumbency as part of their customer due diligence processes to verify information about directors and principal shareholders of corporate customers. However, the availability and meaningfulness of these documents depend on the jurisdiction where the corporate customer is incorporated, affecting the effectiveness of these compliance measures. This reliance forms a critical part of the risk management framework to prevent money laundering and terrorist financing activities [Data: Entities (110, 111), Relationships (171, 172, 184)].\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"summary\": \"The HKMA enforces enhanced surveillance and reporting as supervisory countermeasures against AML/CFT risks\",\n      \"explanation\": \"The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) requires Authorized Institutions to apply enhanced surveillance and reporting measures as part of supervisory countermeasures.
