In jurisdictions where direct company searches are unavailable, Authorized Institutions may rely on Professional Third Parties to act on behalf of their corporate customers. This reliance is conditional upon the Professional Third Parties meeting specific criteria and the absence of any suspicion regarding the legitimacy of the transactions or entities involved. Professional Third Parties play a critical role by providing necessary documentation and information to Authorized Institutions, thereby supporting the institutions’ compliance obligations related to AML/CFT.
