The CRO must possess skills and experience relevant to the AI’s business complexity, maintain sufficient independence and authority to challenge proposals from a risk perspective, have unfettered access to necessary information, and hold duties distinct from other executive functions without management or financial responsibilities related to business lines or revenue-generating functions. The CRO reports directly to the AI’s Chief Executive and regularly to the Board or its Risk Committee, playing a key role in informing them about the AI’s evolving risk profile, breaches of risk limits, and adverse developments related to the AI’s risk appetite.
