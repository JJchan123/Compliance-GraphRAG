Possible management actions outlined in the statement should be realistic and feasible for restoring capital or reducing risk in adverse situations and should not be inconsistent with the AI’s recovery plan (where applicable). 3.2.3 The Board should be satisfied that, and should periodically assess the extent to which, the senior management has put in place robust procedures and controls for implementing and monitoring adherence to the AI’s risk appetite framework and its risk appetite statement. Sufficient information should be compiled to facilitate regular assessment by the Board and senior management of the management of risk against the AI’s risk appetite, such as (i) relevant measures of risk (e.g. based on economic capital or stress tests); (ii) a view of how risk levels compare with limits; (iii) the level of capital that the AI would need to maintain after sustaining a loss of the magnitude of the risk measure; and (iv) the actions that management could take to restore capital after sustaining a loss.)\n\n<|COMPLETE|>", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 531, "prompt_tokens": 1576, "total_tokens": 2107, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 1024, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
