Key entities include the overarching statutory powers, specific conditions imposed under section 16(5), and the revocation of authorization under section 22(1). These entities are interconnected, with the statutory powers enabling the imposition of conditions on AIs to address AML/CFT and other supervisory concerns, as well as the authority to revoke AI authorization following due process. This framework underpins the HKMA's governance and enforcement mechanisms to ensure robust financial compliance and risk management within the banking sector.\",\n  \"findings\": [\n    {\n      \"summary\": \"Statutory powers under the Banking Ordinance form the legal basis for HKMA's supervisory actions\",\n      \"explanation\": \"The statutory powers granted under the Banking Ordinance (BO) empower the HKMA to impose conditions on Authorized Institutions (AIs), take supervisory or enforcement actions, and revoke AI authorizations when necessary. These powers are fundamental to the HKMA's ability to enforce compliance with regulatory standards, including AML/CFT requirements, and to maintain the integrity of the banking sector. The statutory powers serve as the legal foundation for all subsequent supervisory measures and enforcement actions taken by the HKMA [Data: Entities (134)].\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"summary\": \"Conditions under section 16(5) are used to address AML/CFT and other supervisory concerns\",\n      \"explanation\": \"Under section 16(5) of the Banking Ordinance, the HKMA can attach specific conditions to an AI's authorization after providing the institution an opportunity to be heard. These conditions are typically imposed to address identified AML/CFT deficiencies or other supervisory issues. This mechanism allows for targeted intervention to mitigate risks and ensure compliance without immediately resorting to revocation of authorization.

This measure is typically reserved for serious breaches, such as significant AML/CFT violations or other regulatory infractions that threaten the stability or integrity of the financial system.

This relationship creates a layered supervisory framework where the HKMA can escalate its response based on the severity and persistence of compliance issues. Initially, conditions may be imposed to correct deficiencies, and if these are not adequately addressed, revocation may follow.
