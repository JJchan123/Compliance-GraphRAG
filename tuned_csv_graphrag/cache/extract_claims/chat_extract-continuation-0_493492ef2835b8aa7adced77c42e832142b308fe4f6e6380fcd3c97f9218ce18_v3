An AI should have appropriate procedures in place to ensure that all relevant staff (including business units) are aware of and understand these arrangements and their respective roles in the oversight and management of risk. 2.2 Risk appetite framework 2.2.1 In addition to a set of robust risk governance arrangements, it is also important that an AI’s risk management is underpinned by an effective risk appetite framework, which refers to the policies, processes, controls and systems, with clearly defined responsibilities, through which risk appetite is established, communicated and monitored. 2.2.2 The risk appetite framework of an AI should be driven by leadership from the Board and senior management, supplemented as appropriate by the involvement of management at functional and affiliated entity levels, for the purpose of providing information and analysis to facilitate the assessment of risk appetite (by senior management) and the review and final approval of a risk appetite framework and statement (by the Board). The framework should facilitate the embedding of the risk appetite into the AI’s risk culture. The establishment and effective implementation of a risk appetite statement and risk limits are key to a sound risk appetite framework (see subsections 3.2 and 4.2 for more details).)\n\n(BOARD<|>AI<|>RISK APPETITE GOVERNANCE<|>TRUE<|>NONE<|>NONE<|>The Board is responsible for the leadership and final approval of the risk appetite framework and statement within the AI’s risk management.<|>2.2.2 The risk appetite framework of an AI should be driven by leadership from the Board and senior management, supplemented as appropriate by the involvement of management at functional and affiliated entity levels, for the purpose of providing information and analysis to facilitate the assessment of risk appetite (by senior management) and the review and final approval of a risk appetite framework and statement (by the Board).)\n\n(SENIOR MANAGEMENT<|>AI<|>RISK APPETITE GOVERNANCE<|>TRUE<|>NONE<|>NONE<|>Senior management is involved in driving the risk appetite framework of an AI and assessing risk appetite to support the Board’s review and approval.<|>2.2.2 The risk appetite framework of an AI should be driven by leadership from the Board and senior management, supplemented as appropriate by the involvement of management at functional and affiliated entity levels, for the purpose of providing information and analysis to facilitate the assessment of risk appetite (by senior management) and the review and final approval of a risk appetite framework and statement (by the Board).)\n\n(MANAGEMENT AT FUNCTIONAL AND AFFILIATED ENTITY LEVELS<|>AI<|>RISK APPETITE GOVERNANCE<|>TRUE<|>NONE<|>NONE<|>Management at functional and affiliated entity levels is involved in providing information and analysis to facilitate the assessment of risk appetite within the AI.<|>2.2.2 The risk appetite framework of an AI should be driven by leadership from the Board and senior management, supplemented as appropriate by the involvement of management at functional and affiliated entity levels, for the purpose of providing information and analysis to facilitate the assessment of risk appetite (by senior management) and the review and final approval of a risk appetite framework and statement (by the Board).)\n\n<|COMPLETE|>", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 806, "prompt_tokens": 1967, "total_tokens": 2773, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 1920, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
