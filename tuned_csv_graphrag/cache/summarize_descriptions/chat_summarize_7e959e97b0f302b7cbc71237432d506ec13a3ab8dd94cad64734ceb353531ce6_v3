The Internal Audit Function plays a critical role in risk management by promptly reporting material risk management deficiencies and weaknesses directly to the Board for early rectification. Additionally, the Internal Audit Function periodically reports to the Board or its Audit Committee on the effectiveness of risk governance, the risk appetite framework, risk measurement, reporting systems, and internal controls. This reporting enables the Board to effectively oversee the organization's risk management processes and maintain robust internal controls. Together, the Board of Directors and the Internal Audit Function form a key governance partnership that supports effective risk oversight and organizational compliance.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 137, "prompt_tokens": 341, "total_tokens": 478, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
