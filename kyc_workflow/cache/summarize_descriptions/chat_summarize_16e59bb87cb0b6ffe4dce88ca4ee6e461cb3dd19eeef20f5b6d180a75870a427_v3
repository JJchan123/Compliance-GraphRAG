Such exchanges are located in jurisdictions that are members of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) or are specifically listed under Schedule 1 of the Securities and Futures Ordinance, explicitly excluding those in jurisdictions that do not or insufficiently apply FATF Recommendations. Recognised stock exchanges serve as key reference points for Authorized Institutions in conducting customer due diligence and determining verification requirements within ownership chains, enabling simplified due diligence processes for entities listed on these exchanges. This regulatory recognition ensures that these exchanges operate under robust compliance frameworks aligned with international anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing standards.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 139, "prompt_tokens": 449, "total_tokens": 588, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
