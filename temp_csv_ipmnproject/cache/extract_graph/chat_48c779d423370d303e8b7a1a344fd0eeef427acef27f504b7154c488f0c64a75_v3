maintaining monetary and banking stability in Hong Kong, implementing a risk-based supervisory approach to assess the safety and soundness of Authorized Institutions (AIs).)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CAMEL RATING SYSTEM<|>SUPERVISORY FRAMEWORK<|>The CAMEL rating system is a supervisory tool implemented by the HKMA since 1995 to comprehensively assess an AI’s financial condition, compliance with laws and regulations, risk management systems, and overall operating soundness, aimed at identifying AIs requiring special supervisory attention.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RISK-BASED SUPERVISORY APPROACH<|>SUPERVISORY FRAMEWORK<|>A dynamic and forward-looking supervisory framework used by the HKMA that incorporates the risk profile of an AI, balancing inherent risks and the quality of risk

HKMA.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>INTEREST RATE RISK<|>INHERENT RISK<|>The risk that changes in interest rates will negatively impact the value of financial instruments, one of the eight inherent risks assessed by the HKMA.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LIQUIDITY RISK<|>INHERENT RISK<|>The risk that an AI will be unable to meet its short-term financial obligations due to insufficient liquid assets, one of the
