Key entities include the Risk Assessment process, which systematically evaluates risks to guide supervisory focus, and the Supervisory Process that ensures compliance with Primary Prudential Obligations. Expert Judgement complements quantitative risk assessments to address model limitations and macroeconomic factors. Additionally, Risk Transformation highlights how new products or services can alter an AI's risk profile, impacting compliance dynamics. These entities are interlinked, forming a comprehensive framework that supports effective risk management and regulatory adherence within the financial sector.\",\n  \"findings\": [\n    {\n      \"summary\": \"Central role of the Risk-Based Approach (RBA) in supervisory resource allocation\",\n      \"explanation\": \"The Risk-Based Approach (RBA) is pivotal in the HKMA's supervisory framework, guiding the allocation of supervisory resources and engagement efforts based on the ML/TF risk levels of Authorized Institutions. This approach ensures that higher-risk institutions receive more focused supervision, optimizing regulatory oversight efficiency. The RBA's integration with the supervisory process underscores its importance in prioritizing risks and tailoring supervisory actions accordingly, thereby enhancing the effectiveness of compliance monitoring and risk mitigation [Data: Relationships (437, 452)].\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"summary\": \"Risk Assessment as a foundational component of the supervisory process\",\n      \"explanation\": \"Risk Assessment serves as a systematic evaluation process within the supervisory framework, identifying, measuring, and prioritizing risks faced by Authorized Institutions. It enables targeted supervision by highlighting areas of higher risk, thus informing the supervisory process to allocate resources effectively. The close relationship between Risk Assessment and the supervisory process ensures that supervisory efforts are data-driven and risk-focused, which is essential for maintaining the safety and soundness of banking practices [Data: Entities (18), Relationships (24)].\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"summary\": \"Integration of Expert Judgement to enhance risk assessment accuracy\",\n      \"explanation\": \"Expert Judgement complements quantitative risk measurement methods by critically analyzing and interpreting model outputs, considering practical and conceptual limitations as well as relevant macroeconomic trends.

Recognizing these transformations is vital for risk assessment processes to adapt supervisory strategies accordingly. This dynamic aspect of risk necessitates continuous monitoring and adjustment of supervisory focus to address emerging risks effectively and maintain regulatory compliance [Data: Entities (338), Relationships (678)].\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"summary\": \"Supervisory process ensures adherence to Primary Prudential Obligations\",\n      \"explanation\": \"The supervisory process is designed to ensure that Authorized Institutions comply with Primary Prudential Obligations, which are fundamental regulatory requirements and standards enforced by the HKMA to guarantee safe and sound banking practices.
