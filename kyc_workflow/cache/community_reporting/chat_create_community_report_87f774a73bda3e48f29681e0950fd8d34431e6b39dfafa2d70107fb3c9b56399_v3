Key entities include ordering AIs initiating wire transfers, beneficiary AIs receiving funds, and associated roles such as ordering persons and remitting banks. Regulatory frameworks like the FATF Standards and HKMA's Guideline on Prevention of Money Laundering govern these entities. The community's relationships center on ensuring wire transfer messages contain verified originator information, monitoring suspicious transactions through risk-based approaches, and facilitating supervisory requests for originator data.
