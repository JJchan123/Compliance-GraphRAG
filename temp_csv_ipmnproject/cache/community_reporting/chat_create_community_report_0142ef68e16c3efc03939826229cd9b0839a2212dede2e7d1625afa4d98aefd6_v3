The Head of Compliance, appointed and approved by the Board or its designated committee, leads this function with sufficient authority and independence. The Compliance Function may outsource certain legal advice tasks to External Lawyers but retains oversight responsibility. Compliance risk, encompassing potential legal, financial, and reputational damages from non-compliance, is managed through documented compliance policies and continuous monitoring.
