This approach involves conducting focused examinations that identify and evaluate key risk factors affecting an entity's operations and compliance. The culmination of this process is the production of an Examination Report, which documents the findings from the risk-focused examination. This report not only records identified issues and observations but also includes risk management ratings that reflect the institution’s effectiveness in mitigating and controlling those risks. Together, the Risk-Based Supervisory Approach and the Examination Report form an integrated mechanism for ensuring effective governance, risk management, and regulatory compliance within financial organizations.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 126, "prompt_tokens": 290, "total_tokens": 416, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
