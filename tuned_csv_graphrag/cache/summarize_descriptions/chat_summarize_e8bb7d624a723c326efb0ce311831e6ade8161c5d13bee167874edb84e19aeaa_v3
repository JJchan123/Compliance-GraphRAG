Before exercising major enforcement powers, such as revoking or suspending an Authorized Institution’s (AI) authorization, the HKMA consults the Financial Secretary to ensure alignment with broader governmental and financial policy considerations. Additionally, under section 117, the HKMA is required to report to the Financial Secretary when it deems it necessary to initiate inquiries into an Authorized Institution in the interest of protecting depositors or the public. This framework underscores the collaborative governance and oversight role the Financial Secretary holds in supporting the HKMA’s regulatory functions, ensuring effective risk management and safeguarding financial stability within Hong Kong’s banking sector.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 149, "prompt_tokens": 301, "total_tokens": 450, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
