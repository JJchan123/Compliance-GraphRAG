The framework is designed to identify, assess, and mitigate risks related to money laundering and terrorist financing within various banking segments. Key entities include the AML/CFT Supervisory Approach itself, the specific risks of Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing, and the banking segments identified as vulnerable, such as Private Banking, Trade Finance, International Fund Transfers, and Retail and Corporate Banking.

It utilizes a multifaceted methodology including risk profiling, off-site reviews, on-site examinations, self-assessments, and direct engagement with senior management and boards of Authorized Institutions (AIs).
