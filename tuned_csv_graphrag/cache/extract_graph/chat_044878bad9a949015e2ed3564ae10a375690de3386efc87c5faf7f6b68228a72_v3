for supervising authorized institutions (AIs) in Hong Kong, including the implementation of anti-money laundering and counter-financing of terrorism (AML/CFT) supervisory frameworks using a risk-based approach tailored to evolving risks and business models.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AUTHORIZED INSTITUTION<|>AUTHORIZED INSTITUTION<|>Authorized Institutions (AIs) are financial institutions regulated by the HKMA, subject to ongoing AML/CFT supervision and risk assessment to ensure compliance and to mitigate money laundering and terrorist financing risks.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RISK-BASED SUPERVISION<|>SUPERVISORY PROCESS<|>Risk-based supervision (RBA) is the supervisory methodology adopted by the HKMA for AML/CFT oversight, where supervisory engagement intensity is graduated according to the money laundering and terrorist financing (ML/TF) risks posed by different banking sector segments and individual AIs.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AML/CFT SYSTEM<|>AML/CFT SYSTEM<|>The AML/CFT system refers to the comprehensive set of policies, procedures, controls, and supervisory practices implemented by the HKMA and AIs to prevent and detect money laundering and terrorist financing activities.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ML/TF RISK OF THE BANKING SECTOR<|>RISK TYPE<|>The money laundering and terrorist financing (ML/TF) risk of the banking sector is the overall risk exposure of the banking industry in Hong Kong to illicit financial activities, assessed periodically by the HKMA in consultation with the industry and based on domestic and international typologies and supervisory experience.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ML/TF RISK OF INDIVIDUAL AIS<|>RISK TYPE<|>The ML/TF risk of individual Authorized Institutions refers to the specific risk profile of each AI regarding money laundering and terrorist financing threats, which may vary over time due to changes in business models, products, services, customer segments, and technological developments.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SUPERVISORY PROCESS<|>SUPERVISORY PROCESS<|>The supervisory process encompasses the HKMA’s activities including on-site examinations, off-site reviews, and other supervisory engagements, conducted with intensity and focus proportional to the ML/TF risks presented by different banking sector segments and individual AIs.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SUPERVISORY MEASURE<|>SUPERVISORY MEASURE<|>Supervisory measures are actions taken by the HKMA to monitor, guide, and ensure compliance of AIs with AML/CFT requirements, including graduated engagement based on risk levels.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ENFORCEMENT MEASURE<|>ENFORCEMENT MEASURE<|>Enforcement measures refer to regulatory actions imposed by the HKMA on AIs that fail to comply with AML/CFT obligations, intended to address deficiencies and deter non-compliance.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BANKING SECTOR<|>FINANCIAL SECTOR STAKEHOLDER<|>The banking sector in Hong Kong comprises all authorized institutions operating within the jurisdiction, collectively assessed by the HKMA for ML/TF risks and subject to AML/CFT supervision.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HKMA<|>RISK-BASED SUPERVISION<|>The HKMA adopts a risk-based supervision approach for AML/CFT oversight, focusing supervisory resources on higher ML/TF risk AIs while maintaining appropriate engagement with lower risk entities.<|>10)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HKMA<|>SUPERVISORY PROCESS<|>The HKMA conducts supervisory processes including on-site examinations and off-site reviews, calibrated according to the ML/TF risk profiles of banking sector segments and individual AIs.<|>10)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>RISK-BASED SUPERVISION<|>SUPERVISORY PROCESS<|>Risk-based supervision guides the intensity and focus of the

terrorist financing within authorized institutions.<|>10)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HKMA<|>ML/TF RISK OF THE BANKING SECTOR<|>The HKMA periodically assesses the ML/TF risk of the banking sector to

engagement and ensure effective risk mitigation.<|>10)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BANKING SECTOR<|>ML/TF RISK OF THE BANKING SECTOR<|>The banking sector collectively presents the ML/TF risk profile that
