This rating, scored on a scale from one to five, evaluates the effectiveness of an AI’s risk management systems and internal controls across the four key elements of sound risk management for each inherent risk type. It serves as a forward-looking measure of the quality of an AI’s risk management framework and is incorporated into the management component of the CAMEL rating. Additionally, the Risk Management Rating may influence other components of the CAMEL rating, thereby playing a critical role in the overall supervisory evaluation and risk-based supervisory approach applied by the HKMA to ensure effective governance and risk mitigation within financial institutions.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 155, "prompt_tokens": 528, "total_tokens": 683, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
