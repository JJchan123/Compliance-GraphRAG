This condition is comprehensively assessed through multiple dimensions, including asset quality, capital adequacy, earnings, capital strength, and liquidity resources. Evaluations are conducted using risk measurement and management information systems, reliable and timely financial reporting, and robust internal controls. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) plays a key role in this assessment through supervisory processes such as on-site examinations and audit reviews. Additionally, the financial condition is a critical component of the CAMEL rating system, which integrates factors like risk management quality and risk exposures to determine the institution’s soundness. The financial condition also influences regulatory decisions, including the assessment of the scale and risk implications of new activities undertaken by the Authorized Institution.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 165, "prompt_tokens": 396, "total_tokens": 561, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
