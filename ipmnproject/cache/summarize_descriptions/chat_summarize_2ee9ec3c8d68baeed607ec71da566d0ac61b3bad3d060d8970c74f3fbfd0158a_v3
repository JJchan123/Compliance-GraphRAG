As the regulatory authority, the HKMA is responsible for ensuring that AIs comply with the relevant financial laws and maintain effective risk management frameworks to mitigate money laundering (ML) and terrorist financing (TF) risks.\n\nTo fulfill its regulatory responsibilities, the HKMA engages with AIs to assess and manage the risks associated with ML and TF. This engagement is essential for understanding the specific challenges that AIs face and for providing guidance on best practices in risk management. The HKMA issues comprehensive guidelines that AIs are required to follow, which are designed to enhance their risk management practices and ensure compliance with AML/CFT regulations.\n\nUnder the Anti-Money Laundering Ordinance (AMLO), the HKMA has the authority to regulate AIs, ensuring that they implement robust measures to combat financial crimes. This includes the establishment of effective risk management frameworks that are critical for identifying, assessing, and mitigating potential risks related to money laundering and terrorist financing activities.\n\nIn summary, the HKMA serves as a pivotal regulatory body that not only oversees AIs' compliance with AML/CFT regulations but also actively engages with them to promote effective risk management practices. Through its guidelines and regulatory framework, the HKMA aims to foster a secure and compliant financial environment in Hong Kong.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 298, "prompt_tokens": 234, "total_tokens": 532, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
