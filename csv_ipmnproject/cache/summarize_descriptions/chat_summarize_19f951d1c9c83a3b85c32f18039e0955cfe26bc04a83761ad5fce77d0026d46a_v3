This strategy focuses on identifying and prioritizing higher-risk areas, enabling the HKMA to effectively manage and supervise Authorized Institutions (AIs) against the significant risks associated with money laundering and terrorist financing. Furthermore, the HKMA expects AIs to implement this risk-based approach in their operations, ensuring they adequately address and mitigate AML/CFT risks while adhering to regulatory standards.
