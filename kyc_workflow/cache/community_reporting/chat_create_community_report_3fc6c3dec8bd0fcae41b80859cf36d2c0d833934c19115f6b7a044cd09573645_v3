The ownership chain represents the sequence of entities or individuals through which ownership of a company is held, which AIs must thoroughly analyze to uncover ultimate beneficial owners. This process is essential for managing Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Counter Financing of Terrorism (CFT) risks. The relationships highlight the responsibility of AIs to verify beneficial owners at every ownership level, ensuring transparency and compliance with regulatory standards. This interconnected structure supports robust governance, risk management, and supervisory oversight within the financial sector.\",\n  \"findings\": [\n    {\n      \"summary\": \"Authorized Institutions' responsibility in tracing ownership chains\",\n      \"explanation\": \"Authorized Institutions bear the responsibility to verify the identities of beneficial owners throughout the entire ownership chain. This involves a comprehensive tracing process to ensure transparency and to effectively mitigate risks associated with money laundering and terrorist financing.
