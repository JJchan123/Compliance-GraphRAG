This includes on-site visitations to gather information, adopting AI’s own classification of business lines for analysis, and assessing inherent risk levels (high, moderate, low) for functional activities to evaluate potential adverse impacts on AI’s capital or earnings.<|>1.5.7 In phase one, sufficient information must be gathered to understand fully the business activities and risk management systems of the AI. This can be accomplished by conducting one or more on-site visitations to the AI to obtain the required information or to clarify information already received.\n##\n(HKMA<|>AI<|>RISK ASSESSMENT<|>TRUE<|>NONE<|>NONE<|>HKMA assesses the level of inherent risk for each functional activity of AI as high, moderate, or low based on qualitative and quantitative factors, considering potential loss relative to earnings and capital, to determine the probability and impact of adverse events.<|>1.5.9 There are four steps involved in phase three. The initial step is to identify the level of inherent risk by functional activity for each of the eight inherent risks. The level of inherent risk, which is a judgement call by the case officer, can be assessed as \"high\", \"moderate\" or \"low\". Qualitative as well as quantitative factors will be considered for each functional activity in arriving at the judgement. Generally speaking, based on the statistical theory of probability, moderate inherent risk exists when there is an average probability or chance of an adverse impact on an AI’s capital or earnings due to exposure and uncertainty from potential future events within the functional activity. An assessment of high inherent risk would reflect a higher than average probability of potential loss and an assessment of low inherent risk would reflect a lower than average probability. In arriving at the level of inherent risk, the degree of potential loss in relation to earnings and capital must also be considered and factored into the decision. High inherent risk could reasonably be expected to result in a significant and harmful loss to the AI. Moderate inherent risk could reasonably be expected to result in a loss, which could be absorbed by the AI in the normal course of business and low inherent risk could reasonably be expected to result in little or no loss)\n<|COMPLETE|>", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 512, "prompt_tokens": 1572, "total_tokens": 2084, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 1152, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
