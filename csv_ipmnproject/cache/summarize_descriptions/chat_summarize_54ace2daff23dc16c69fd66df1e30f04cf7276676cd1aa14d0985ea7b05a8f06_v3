This risk encompasses both funding liquidity risk and market liquidity risk, which can hinder the AI's capacity to liquidate assets or secure necessary funding. It is recognized as one of the eight inherent risks that the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) mandates AIs to assess and manage. Furthermore, liquidity risk is categorized as a material risk area that should be addressed in risk management reports and is considered a quantifiable risk that AIs must navigate through established risk limits. Additionally, the evaluation of liquidity risk is crucial when introducing new products or services, ensuring that the institution maintains adequate liquidity to meet its short-term financial obligations.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 158, "prompt_tokens": 466, "total_tokens": 624, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
