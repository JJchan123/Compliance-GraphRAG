This risk is particularly significant for Authorized Institutions (AIs) as it directly impacts their compliance and risk management strategies. It is crucial when evaluating new products or services, as any legal ambiguities can disrupt operations or adversely affect financial conditions. \n\nLEGAL RISK is explicitly included in the risk appetite statement of AIs and is recognized as one of the eight inherent risks assessed by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA). This risk encompasses the possibility of unenforceable contracts, lawsuits, or adverse judgments, all of which can have detrimental effects on an AI's operations.
