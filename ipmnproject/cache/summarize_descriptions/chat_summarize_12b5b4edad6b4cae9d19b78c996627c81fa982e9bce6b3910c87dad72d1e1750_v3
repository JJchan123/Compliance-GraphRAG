This requirement emphasizes the importance of identifying and controlling various risks that may affect the operations of AIs. The Risk Management System serves as a critical component of the AI's operational framework, ensuring that potential risks are effectively managed.\n\nThe implementation of this system is designed to address the risks identified during the risk assessment process of the AI. By adhering to the HKMA's guidelines, AIs can systematically evaluate and mitigate risks, thereby enhancing their overall stability and reliability. The integration of a robust Risk Management System not only aligns with regulatory expectations but also supports the sustainable growth and operational integrity of AI entities.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 149, "prompt_tokens": 226, "total_tokens": 375, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
