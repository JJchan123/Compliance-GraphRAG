Central to this ecosystem are the Board of Directors and its Risk Committee, which provide oversight and delegated authority for risk governance. The Chief Risk Officer (CRO) acts as the senior executive responsible for implementing and maintaining the institution’s risk management framework, coordinating with senior management and business units. The New Product Approval Process and Policy ensure rigorous assessment and control of risks associated with new or modified products and services, integrating AML/CFT considerations. Risk Management Policies, Risk Appetite Frameworks, and Risk Limits establish the parameters for risk-taking and monitoring.
