This risk is recognized as one of the eight inherent risks that must be assessed and managed by Authorized Institutions (AIs) as mandated by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA). Market risk is particularly significant as it must be evaluated in the context of new products or services introduced by AIs. It is categorized as a material risk area that should be comprehensively addressed in risk management reports. Furthermore, market risk is quantifiable and requires AIs to implement risk limits to effectively manage it. This risk encompasses the potential adverse effects on an AI's financial condition stemming from fluctuations in market rates or prices, including foreign exchange rates, commodity prices, and equity prices, all of which are influenced by market volatility and the institution's business strategy.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 170, "prompt_tokens": 416, "total_tokens": 586, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
