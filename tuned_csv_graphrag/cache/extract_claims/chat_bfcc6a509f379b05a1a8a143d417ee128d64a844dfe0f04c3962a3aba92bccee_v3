Risk management systems and processes.\nversion: V.3 - 06.10.2017.\n Risk Officer should ensure that prompt action is taken when any material risk exposure is close to, or exceeds, the AI’s approved risk appetite and relevant risk limits. Furthermore, the Chief Risk Officer should participate in key decision-making processes (e.g. strategic planning, capital and liquidity planning, new products and services approvals, remuneration design and operation) and should be involved in the setting of risk-related performance indicators for business units.\n\n5.2 Risk management information system9\n\n5.2.1 An AI should establish and maintain a management information system with adequate technological support and processing capacity (even in times of stress) to effectively capture, aggregate and report on the risks of major business activities within the organisation. The risk data aggregation and risk reporting framework and any substantial change to them should be reviewed and approved by the Board (or its Risk Committee) and senior management.\n\n5.2.2 The level of sophistication of an AI’s risk management information system should be commensurate with the nature, scale and complexity of the AI’s business activities. Generally, to support decision-making at different levels and enable early identification of emerging risks, it should be capable of:\n\naccurately and reliably capturing, aggregating and reporting risk data in a timely manner, not only in normal times but also in times of stress. While different types of data will be required at different intervals, the system should be able to generate any necessary data rapidly in times of stress;\ncapturing, aggregating and reporting risk data on all sources of relevant risks on a range of bases, including by business line, product, portfolio, function, and at entity and group levels;\nsupporting customised identification, aggregation and reporting of risks (e.g. based on individual or a set of closely related risk drivers) to meet requests of the Board, senior management and other users, including the HKMA;\nincorporating changes arising from regulatory requirements and new business developments as and when necessary;\nsupporting a broad range of risk management analysis)\n<|COMPLETE|>", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 518, "prompt_tokens": 1570, "total_tokens": 2088, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 1024, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
