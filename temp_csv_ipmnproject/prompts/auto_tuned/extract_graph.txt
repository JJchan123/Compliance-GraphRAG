-Goal-
Given a text document that is potentially relevant to this activity and a list of entity types, identify all entities of those types from the text and all relationships among the identified entities.

-Steps-
1. Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:
- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized
- entity_type: One of the following types: [organization, risk, supervisory framework, financial condition, compliance, risk management system, inherent risk, credit risk, market risk, interest rate risk, liquidity risk, operational risk, reputation risk, legal risk, strategic risk, emerging risk, AI]
- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities
Format each entity as ("entity"{tuple_delimiter}<entity_name>{tuple_delimiter}<entity_type>{tuple_delimiter}<entity_description>)

2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.
For each pair of related entities, extract the following information:
- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1
- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1
- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other
- relationship_strength: an integer score between 1 to 10, indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity
Format each relationship as ("relationship"{tuple_delimiter}<source_entity>{tuple_delimiter}<target_entity>{tuple_delimiter}<relationship_description>{tuple_delimiter}<relationship_strength>)

3. Return output in en as a single list of all the entities and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **{record_delimiter}** as the list delimiter.

4. If you have to translate into en, just translate the descriptions, nothing else!

5. When finished, output {completion_delimiter}.

 systems at Als, into the CAMEL rating system. Each of the CAMEL components is, as shown in the following diagram, affected by one or more of the eight inherent risks (credit, market, interest rate, liquidity, operational, legal, reputation and strategic), which the HKMA has identified as risks to be assessed during the supervisory process. These eight inherent risks are described in section 2 below.

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-10-17/4b70d29d-a521-4c6c-92cd-b0442bf201e9/5e6fb3b7619c11ccb4ee6ed8af410c1bbecdf762a4a76f25e35bed37d39ace90.jpg)

1.3.4 Under the risk-based approach, a change in the CAMEL rating of an AI may result from the qualitative analysis of its risk profile in addition to the more traditional quantitative analysis of its financial data. An example of such a change would be a down-grade in asset quality to a "3" for an AI which displays current indicators representing an asset quality of "2" but whose credit risk, as a result of recent aggressive lending practices and less than satisfactory credit risk management systems, has been assessed as high.  
1.3.5 This approach to supervision does not eliminate or change the quantitative approach to assessing the components of the CAMEL rating system but it adds a new dimension, which enables the supervisory process to inject more judgement, based on a forward perspective, in arriving at a final rating.  
1.3.6 The risk-focused examination process places more emphasis on an evaluation of the quality of risk management systems and internal controls. A risk management rating is assigned taking into account the results of the on-site examination and formally incorporated into the management component of the CAMEL rating. It may also influence the ratings given to the other CAMEL components, as illustrated in para. 1.3.4 above. Section 3 below gives details of the four elements of a sound risk management system and

section 4 describes the risk management rating system.

# 1.4 Risk-based approach and methodology

1.4.1 The risk-based supervisory approach, which emphasises effective planning and examiner judgement, customises examinations to suit the size and activities of Als and to concentrate examiner resources on areas that expose the AI concerned to the greatest degree of risk.  
1.4.2 The risk-based methodology, shown in the diagram below, consists of six key steps.

 supervision as the banking sector develops and risk profiles of Als change in reaction to competitive forces. This should also benefit Als as regulatory effort is focused on high-risk areas warranting management attention.

# 1.2 Key benefits

1.2.1 The key benefits for both the HKMA and Als from this risk-based supervisory framework are:

- better evaluation of risks through separate assessment of inherent risks and risk management processes;  
- greater emphasis on early identification of emerging risks at individual Als and on a sector-wide basis;  
- cost-effective use of resources through a sharper focus on risks, which in time should result in examination teams spending less time on site at individual AIs;  
- more utilisation by the HKMA of management information prepared by AIs;  
- a better appreciation by supervisors of the management quality of Als, the characteristics of their business and the risks they face;  
- enhanced value of the supervisory work performed to both the management of Als and the supervisors, who have a common interest in ensuring that risks are properly identified and that adequate and effective control systems are established to monitor and control risks; and  
cost of supervision, in terms of management time of an AI, will be more directly related to the AI's

risk profile, i.e. the intensity of supervision and the amount and focus of supervisory action will increase or decrease in line with the perceived risk profile of the AI.

# 1.3 Integration with CAMEL rating system

1.3.1 The CAMEL  $^{{1}}$  rating system, which has been implemented at the HKMA since 1995, is designed to assess in a comprehensive manner an Al's financial condition, compliance with laws and regulations, risk management systems and overall operating soundness. Its primary purpose is to help identify those Als where weaknesses in the aforementioned areas require special supervisory attention or warrant a higher than normal degree of supervisory concern.  
1.3.2 Risk-based supervision is a dynamic and forward-looking approach, which provides the supervisory process with the necessary framework to factor the risk profile of an AI into the CAMEL rating system. Risk-taking has always been present in the banking business, and rightfully so, but has increased significantly, primarily due to the need to remain competitive in a fast-paced environment.  
1.3.3 The risk-based methodology incorporates the risk profile, which is ascertained by balancing the level of inherent risk with the quality of risk management systems at Als, into the CAMEL rating system. Each of the CAMEL components is, as shown in the following diagram, affected by one or more of the eight inherent risks (credit, market, interest rate, liquidity, operational, legal, reputation and strategic), which the HKMA has identified as risks to be assessed during the supervisory process. These eight inherent risks are described in section 2 below.

# 1. Supervisory framework

# 1.1 Introduction

1.1.1 The objective of the supervisory framework of the HKMA is to provide an effective process to monitor and assess the safety and soundness of Als on a continuing basis. The process follows a risk-based approach. It consists of a structured methodology designed to establish a forward-looking view on the risk profile of Als. This permits a direct and specific focus on the areas of greatest risk to an AI. It also enables the HKMA to be

more proactive and better positioned to pre-empt any serious threat to the stability of the banking system from any current or emerging risks.

1.1.2 The adoption of a well-structured risk-based framework allows the HKMA to continue to deliver consistent, high-quality supervision as the banking sector develops and risk profiles of Als change in reaction to competitive forces. This should also benefit Als as regulatory effort is focused on high-risk areas warranting management attention.

# 1.2 Key benefits

1.2.1 The key benefits for both the HKMA and Als from this risk-based supervisory framework are:

- better evaluation of risks through separate assessment of inherent risks and risk management processes;  
- greater emphasis on early identification of emerging risks at individual Als and on
