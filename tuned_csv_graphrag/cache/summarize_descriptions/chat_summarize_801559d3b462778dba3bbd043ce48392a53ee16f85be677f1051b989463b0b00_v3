They are responsible for implementing and maintaining effective risk governance practices, including adherence to established risk management policies and the use of risk management information systems. Senior Management manages day-to-day risk management activities and supports the Chief Risk Officer in these efforts. They ensure timely and accurate communication of risk information to enable early identification and mitigation of risks, responding promptly to reports of risk limit breaches and ensuring appropriate risk mitigation actions are taken. Additionally, Senior Management provides critical information and controls that support the Board of Directors’ oversight responsibilities. They also participate in the approval and management of new products, promoting risk awareness and fostering open communication about risk-taking throughout the organization.
