These reports aggregate validated and reconciled risk data across material risk areas including credit, market, interest rate, liquidity, operational, reputational, legal, and strategic risks. They provide comprehensive insights to Boards, senior management, and regulators, facilitating effective governance, risk oversight, and compliance with regulatory requirements. The relationships between these entities underscore the integral role of risk reporting in monitoring risk exposures, ensuring adherence to risk appetite and limits, and supporting forward-looking risk assessments and supervisory processes.\",\n  \"findings\": [\n    {\n      \"summary\": \"Risk Management Reports as the central compliance tool\",\n      \"explanation\": \"Risk Management Reports are the cornerstone of the risk governance framework within Authorized Institutions. They consolidate detailed information on all material risk areas, ensuring that Boards and senior management receive clear, concise, and comprehensive insights necessary for informed decision-making. These reports are rigorously validated and reconciled to maintain data accuracy, meeting the standards expected by both internal governance and external regulators such as the HKMA.
