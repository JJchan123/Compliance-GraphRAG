Key entities include enforcement measures such as pecuniary penalties, supervisory measures, and the roles of prosecuting authorities and the Secretary for Justice. The relationships highlight how enforcement measures encompass financial sanctions and prosecutions, while supervisory measures involve regulatory oversight and remedial actions. Repeat failures by AIs to comply escalate enforcement severity, underscoring the dynamic interaction between regulatory oversight and disciplinary actions to maintain financial system integrity.\",\n  \"findings\": [\n    {\n      \"summary\": \"Enforcement measures are comprehensive regulatory and disciplinary actions by HKMA\",\n      \"explanation\": \"Enforcement measures represent a broad spectrum of actions taken by the HKMA against Authorized Institutions or individuals for breaches of AML/CFT regulations and supervisory requirements. These include administrative actions like issuing letters and compliance advice, as well as formal disciplinary actions such as remedial orders, pecuniary penalties, public reprimands, and prosecutions. The enforcement approach is proportionate and aims to address serious deficiencies, deter abuse, and reinforce compliance and risk management within financial institutions. The HKMA also considers cooperation levels during enforcement to ensure fairness and effectiveness in promoting adherence to regulatory standards [Data: Entities (52)].\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"summary\": \"Pecuniary penalties serve as significant financial sanctions within enforcement measures\",\n      \"explanation\": \"Pecuniary penalties are financial sanctions imposed by the HKMA on Authorized Institutions for AML/CFT breaches under the AMLO. These penalties are guided by principles that consider the institution's cooperation during investigations. The penalties can be substantial, amounting to the greater of HKD 10,000,000 or three times the profit gained or costs avoided due to the contravention. Additionally, daily penalties of up to HKD 100,000 may be imposed for ongoing non-compliance. This financial deterrent reinforces the regulatory framework to ensure effective governance and risk management within the financial sector [Data: Entities (186); Relationships (337, 336)].\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"summary\": \"Supervisory measures are proactive regulatory tools to monitor and enforce compliance\",\n      \"explanation\": \"Supervisory measures are actions primarily undertaken by the HKMA to monitor, guide, and enforce compliance and risk management standards within Authorized Institutions. These measures aim to maintain financial stability and ensure adherence to AML/CFT requirements. They include intensified supervision, issuance of directives, remediation requirements, and independent validation of corrective actions. Supervisory measures also encompass public reprimands, remedial orders, and pecuniary penalties for contraventions.

Prosecuting authorities are government bodies that initiate and conduct these prosecutions. Their involvement represents the formal legal enforcement arm of the regulatory framework, ensuring that serious breaches are addressed through judicial processes. This collaboration between supervisory and prosecutorial entities strengthens the enforcement regime and upholds the integrity of the financial system [Data: Entities (193, 194); Relationships (338, 339)].\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"summary\": \"Repeat failures by Authorized Institutions escalate enforcement severity\",\n      \"explanation\": \"Authorized Institutions that repeatedly fail to address compliance deficiencies or act on compliance advice increase their risk of facing more serious enforcement measures by the HKMA.
