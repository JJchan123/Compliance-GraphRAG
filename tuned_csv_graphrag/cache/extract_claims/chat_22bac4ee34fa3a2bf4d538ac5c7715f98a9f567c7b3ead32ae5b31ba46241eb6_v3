The eight types of inherent risk. version: V.2-23.12.2022. 2.9 Emerging risk types 2.9.1 From time to time new risk types may emerge and can have implications for one or more of the eight inherent risks mentioned above. 2.9.2 One example is climate risk3. Climate risk may affect AIs’ exposures to multiple inherent risks. For instance, climate risk drivers may lead to business disruption affecting the repayment ability of borrowers, thereby increasing AIs’ exposure to credit risk. AIs may also face heightened reputation risk with changing market and consumer sentiment towards more climate or environmentally-friendly products, services and business practices.)\n\n<|COMPLETE|>", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 245, "prompt_tokens": 1376, "total_tokens": 1621, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 1024, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
