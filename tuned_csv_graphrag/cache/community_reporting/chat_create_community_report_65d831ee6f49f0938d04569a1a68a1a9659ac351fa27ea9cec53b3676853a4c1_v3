The HKMA collaborates closely with the JFIU, which acts as a critical intermediary by receiving suspicious transaction reports from AIs and providing feedback to the HKMA to enhance AML/CFT supervisory reviews and guidance. Law enforcement agencies rely on the JFIU to receive these reports for investigation and prosecution of money laundering (ML) and terrorist financing (TF) offenses.
