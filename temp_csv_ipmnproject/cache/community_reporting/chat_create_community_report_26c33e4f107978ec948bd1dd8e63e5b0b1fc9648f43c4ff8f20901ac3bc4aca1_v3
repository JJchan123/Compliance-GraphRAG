Key entities include the HKMA's Investigations and Enforcement Proceedings, Enforcement Tools, the Anti-Money Laundering Ordinance (AMLO), Repeat Failures by AIs, and the Cooperation Policy. The relationships depict a structured process where the AMLO empowers the HKMA with enforcement tools to investigate and address AML/CFT compliance issues. The HKMA conducts investigations and enforcement proceedings to ensure adherence to AML regulations.
