This issue is a critical concern for financial regulators and law enforcement agencies, including regulatory bodies such as the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA). Financial institutions are required to manage these risks under the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT) regulations, specifically the Anti-Money Laundering Ordinance (AMLO). The sources of funds for terrorist financing can be both legal and illegal, which complicates compliance and risk management efforts for financial institutions. As such, terrorist financing represents a key focus area for regulatory measures aimed at preventing the misuse of financial systems for supporting terrorism.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 154, "prompt_tokens": 466, "total_tokens": 620, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
