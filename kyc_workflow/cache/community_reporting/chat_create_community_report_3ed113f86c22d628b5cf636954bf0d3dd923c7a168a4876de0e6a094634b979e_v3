The key entities include the identity verification process itself and the official identity documents used, such as identity cards and travel documents. The relationships highlight how identity verification is essential for non-physical presence customer verification and relies heavily on government-issued identity cards or travel documents. This structure underscores the importance of robust customer due diligence and AML/CFT compliance measures in mitigating financial crime risks within the banking sector.\",\n  \"findings\": [\n    {\n      \"summary\": \"Identity Verification as a Core Compliance Function\",\n      \"explanation\": \"Identity verification is a fundamental component of the customer due diligence process mandated for Authorized Institutions. It involves collecting and confirming evidence to establish the true identity of customers, directors, and principal shareholders. This process is crucial for mitigating risks related to financial crimes such as money laundering and terrorist financing. By ensuring accurate identification, institutions enhance the integrity of customer onboarding and ongoing monitoring procedures, thereby supporting effective risk management and regulatory compliance [Data: Entities (59)].\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"summary\": \"Use of Official Identity Documents in Verification\",\n      \"explanation\": \"The identity verification process depends on official government-issued documents, including identity cards, travel documents, national identity cards, or driving licenses issued by competent authorities. These documents serve as the primary evidence to confirm the identities of transaction parties, ensuring that Authorized Institutions comply with AML/CFT regulations.
