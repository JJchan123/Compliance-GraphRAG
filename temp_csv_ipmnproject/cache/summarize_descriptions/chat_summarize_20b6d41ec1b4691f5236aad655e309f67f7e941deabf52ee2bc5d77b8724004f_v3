This framework is developed and approved by the Board and implemented by senior management to ensure alignment with the AI’s business goals, strategic plans, and risk appetite. It includes internal controls, audits, compliance functions, contingency planning, and tools such as limits, capital and liquidity management strategies, stress testing, and scenario analyses to manage risk exposures prudently.\n\nThe framework facilitates timely, accurate, and clear communication of material risk-related information to the Board, senior management, responsible officers, and heads of control functions, enabling early and appropriate risk mitigation actions. It is designed to maintain the institution’s safety and soundness and is periodically reviewed to remain adequate under changing conditions. The system is tailored proportionally to the size and complexity of the AI’s operations and complies with regulatory requirements set forth by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA), ensuring that risk management practices are effective and commensurate with the institution’s risk appetite and business activities.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 233, "prompt_tokens": 772, "total_tokens": 1005, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
