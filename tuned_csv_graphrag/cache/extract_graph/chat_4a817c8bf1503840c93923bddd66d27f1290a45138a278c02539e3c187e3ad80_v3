It employs a risk-based supervisory approach to monitor and assess the safety and soundness of AIs on a continuing basis, focusing supervisory efforts according to the risk profile of each AI.)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>AUTHORIZED INSTITUTION<|>AUTHORIZED INSTITUTION<|>Authorized Institutions (AIs) are financial institutions licensed and regulated by the HKMA. They are subject to ongoing supervision and assessment to ensure their financial condition, compliance, risk management systems, and overall operating soundness.)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>CAMEL RATING SYSTEM<|>SUPERVISORY PROCESS<|>The CAMEL rating system is a comprehensive supervisory tool implemented by the HKMA since 1995 to assess an AI’s financial condition, compliance with laws and regulations, risk management systems, and overall operating soundness. It helps identify AIs requiring special supervisory attention or higher supervisory concern.)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>RISK-BASED SUPERVISORY APPROACH<|>SUPERVISORY PROCESS<|>The risk-based supervisory approach is a dynamic and forward-looking supervisory methodology used by the HKMA. It integrates the risk profile of an AI, balancing inherent risk levels with the quality of risk management systems, into the CAMEL rating system to focus supervisory resources on areas of greatest risk.  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>CREDIT RISK<|>RISK TYPE<|>Credit risk is one of the eight inherent risks identified by the HKMA, representing the potential loss due to borrower default or deterioration in asset quality.)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>MARKET RISK<|>RISK TYPE<|>Market risk is an inherent risk type involving potential losses due to changes in market prices or rates.)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>INTEREST RATE RISK<|>RISK TYPE<|>Interest rate risk is the risk of loss resulting from changes in interest rates affecting an AI’s financial condition.)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>LIQUIDITY RISK<|>RISK TYPE<|>Liquidity risk is the risk that an AI cannot meet its financial obligations as they come due without incurring unacceptable losses.)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>OPERATIONAL RISK<|>RISK TYPE<|>Operational risk refers to potential losses from inadequate or failed internal processes, people, systems, or external events.)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>LEGAL RISK<|>RISK TYPE<|>Legal risk involves potential losses due to legal actions, non-compliance with laws, or contractual failures.)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>REPUTATION RISK<|>RISK TYPE<|>Reputation risk is the risk of loss resulting from damage to an AI’s reputation, affecting its ability to maintain existing or establish new relationships.)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>STRATEGIC RISK<|>RISK TYPE<|>Strategic risk is the risk arising from adverse business decisions, improper implementation of decisions, or lack of responsiveness to industry changes.)  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>HKMA<|>AUTHORIZED INSTITUTION<|>The HKMA supervises Authorized Institutions using a risk-based supervisory approach to ensure their safety and soundness.<|>10)  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>HKMA<|>CAMEL RATING SYSTEM<|>The HKMA uses the CAMEL rating system as a supervisory tool to assess the financial condition, compliance, and risk management systems of Authorized Institutions.<|>10)  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>HKMA<|>RISK-BASED SUPERVISORY APPROACH<|>The HKMA employs the risk-based supervisory approach as its methodology for supervising Authorized Institutions.<|>10)  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>RISK-BASED SUPERVISORY APPROACH<|>CAMEL RATING SYSTEM<|>The risk-based supervisory approach integrates the risk profile of Authorized Institutions into the CAMEL rating system to provide a forward-looking assessment.<|>9)  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>AUTHORIZED INSTITUTION<|>RISK TYPE<|>Authorized Institutions are assessed for eight inherent risk types including credit, market, interest rate, liquidity, operational, legal, reputation, and strategic risks.<|>10)  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>RISK-BASED SUPERVISORY APPROACH<|>RISK TYPE<|>The risk-based supervisory approach incorporates the assessment of eight inherent risk types to evaluate the risk profile of Authorized Institutions.<|>9)  \n<|COMPLETE|>", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 992, "prompt_tokens": 6206, "total_tokens": 7198, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 1664, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
