Frequency, timeliness, contents, granularity, distribution and level of confidentiality of risk management reports should be appropriate for the needs of recipients. While individual AIs should determine risk reporting requirements that are appropriate for their own business models and risk profiles, at a minimum, the reports should cover all material risk areas (e.g. credit, market, interest rate, liquidity, operational, reputation, legal and strategic risks) and provide information in respect of risk concentrations, adherence to risk appetite and risk limits and forwardlooking assessment of risks. In addition, the risk management reports should provide information relating to regulatory ratios (e.g. capital adequacy ratios and liquidity ratios) and their projections.)\n\n(THE BOARD<|>HKMA<|>GOVERNANCE<|>TRUE<|>NONE<|>NONE<|>The Board is involved as a key user of the risk management systems and processes established by HKMA.<|>the Board, senior management and other users, including the HKMA;)\n\n(SENIOR MANAGEMENT<|>HKMA<|>GOVERNANCE<|>TRUE<|>NONE<|>NONE<|>Senior management is involved as a key user of the risk management systems and processes established by HKMA.<|>the Board, senior management and other users, including the HKMA;)\n\n(INDIVIDUAL AIS<|>NONE<|>RISK REPORTING RESPONSIBILITY<|>TRUE<|>NONE<|>NONE<|>Individual Authorized Institutions (AIs) should determine risk reporting requirements appropriate for their own business models and risk profiles.<|>While individual AIs should determine risk reporting requirements that are appropriate for their own business models and risk profiles, at a minimum, the reports should cover all material risk areas...)\n\n(RISK MANAGEMENT REPORTS<|>NONE<|>RISK COMMUNICATION<|>TRUE<|>NONE<|>NONE<|>Risk management reports should communicate information in a clear and concise manner, be comprehensive enough for informed decision-making and risk assessment, and cover material risk areas and regulatory ratios.<|>5.2.3 Risk management reports should communicate information in a clear and concise manner, but yet be comprehensive enough to be useful for informed decision-making and risk assessment.
