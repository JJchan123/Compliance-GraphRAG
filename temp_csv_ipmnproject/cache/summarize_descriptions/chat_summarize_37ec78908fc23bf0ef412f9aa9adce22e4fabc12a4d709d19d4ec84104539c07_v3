It is responsible for periodically evaluating the performance and adequacy of internal controls, risk management policies, and control procedures to ensure they operate as intended and support the overall risk governance arrangements. This function conducts thorough reviews across various areas, including the new product approval process—encompassing business units, risk management, and internal control functions—to ensure effective risk oversight and regulatory compliance. Additionally, the internal audit function independently assesses the work of the compliance function, evaluates all material risks and related risk management processes, and validates the implementation and effectiveness of remedial actions addressing Anti-Money Laundering and Counter Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT) deficiencies. When aligned with Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) standards, the internal audit function’s work enables the HKMA to place greater reliance on its findings during supervisory examinations, thereby reinforcing the AI’s overall risk management and compliance posture.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 223, "prompt_tokens": 481, "total_tokens": 704, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
