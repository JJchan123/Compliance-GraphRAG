This framework is crucial for ensuring that AIs operate within their risk appetite while adhering to regulatory requirements. It encompasses methodologies such as stress testing and scenario analyses, which are essential for evaluating risks associated with financial products and services. By following this framework, AIs can maintain financial soundness and align their risk management practices with strategic objectives and regulatory obligations.
