Responsibilities of the Board and senior management. version: V.3 - 06.10.2017. restricted licence banks or deposit-taking companies (other than one designated by the Monetary Authority under $\\ S 3 \\mathsf S$ or $\\ S 3 0$ of the Banking (Capital) Rules (BCR) as systemically important) with a relatively small and simple business operation and low risk profile, should establish a Risk Committee. All other locally incorporated AIs are also strongly encouraged to do so. The Risk Committee should: be a stand-alone committee and distinct from the Board’s Audit Committee; be chaired by an independent non-executive director with a background in accounting, banking or other relevant financial industry or expertise in risk management. “Dual-hatting” with the chair of the Board or any other committee should be avoided; be composed of a majority of members who are independent non-executive directors. Members of the Risk Committee should collectively possess relevant technical expertise and experience in risk disciplines that are adequate to enable them to discharge their responsibilities effectively; review and recommend for the Board’s approval the AI’s risk management strategies, key risk policies and risk appetite, at least annually; exercise its authority (if delegated by the Board) to review and approve specified types of risk management policies and procedures, as appropriate; review and assess the adequacy of the AI’s risk management framework and policies in identifying, measuring, monitoring and controlling risks and the extent to which these are operating effectively; oversee the establishment and maintenance by senior management of appropriate infrastructure, resources and systems for risk management, particularly in relation to the AI’s adherence to the approved risk appetite and related policies; oversee and discuss the strategies for capital and liquidity management, and those for all relevant risks (on both an aggregated basis and by type of risk) of the AI, to ensure they are consistent with the stated risk appetite; oversee and challenge the design and execution of stress testing and scenario analyses; review periodic reports provided by the senior management (including the Chief Risk Officer) on the state of the AI’s risk culture)\n<|COMPLETE|>", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 581, "prompt_tokens": 1575, "total_tokens": 2156, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 1024, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
