It is charged with setting the overall business strategy and ensuring that the institution operates within established risk appetite and limits. The Board oversees the institution’s risk management framework, including the approval and ongoing monitoring of risk management policies and significant risk issues escalated by the Chief Risk Officer. It also holds accountability for the effectiveness of Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT) systems and ensures compliance with all relevant regulatory requirements.\n\nFor locally incorporated banks, the Board engages directly with the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) through annual meetings following risk-focused on-site examinations, during which supervisory findings and prudential matters are discussed. The Board receives direct communications from the HKMA regarding supervisory concerns, particularly those related to AML/CFT systems and controls, reinforcing its role in maintaining robust governance and regulatory adherence. Additionally, the Board or designated committees within the AI are responsible for approving risk limits, conducting regular reviews to ensure these limits remain aligned with evolving business strategies and market conditions, thereby maintaining effective oversight of the institution’s risk profile and operational integrity.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 254, "prompt_tokens": 462, "total_tokens": 716, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
