This methodology integrates various inherent risks into the CAMEL rating system, which assesses the overall health and stability of financial institutions. By focusing on the specific risks associated with different segments of the banking sector and individual AIs, RISK-BASED SUPERVISION enables the HKMA to allocate resources effectively.
