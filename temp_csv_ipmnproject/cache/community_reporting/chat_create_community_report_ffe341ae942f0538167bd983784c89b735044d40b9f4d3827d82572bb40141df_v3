The RMS is supported and overseen by key entities such as the Risk Management Committee and incorporates multiple components including policies, procedures, limit structures, internal controls, audits, and compliance monitoring. It integrates qualitative and quantitative approaches, risk data aggregation, stress testing, sensitivity analysis, and valuation practices to ensure robust risk assessment and management. The system also encompasses contingency planning elements like business continuity, contingency funding, and recovery planning to maintain operational resilience. The relationships among these entities reflect a structured and multi-layered approach to risk governance, aligned with the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's supervisory framework and CAMEL rating criteria.\",\n  \"findings\": [\n    {\n      \"summary\": \"Central Role of the Risk Management System in Managing Inherent Risks\",\n      \"explanation\": \"The Risk Management System (RMS) is the pivotal entity in this community, designed to comprehensively manage all types of risks inherent in the business activities of Authorized Institutions (AIs), including credit, market, interest rate, liquidity, operational, legal, reputation, and strategic risks. It encompasses a structured framework supported by policies, procedures, internal controls, and organizational structures aligned with actual operations. The RMS ensures active oversight by the Board and senior management, clear segregation of duties, and established limits to control risk exposures. This central role is underscored by its numerous relationships with other key components such as risk measurement tools, control mechanisms, and contingency planning processes, highlighting its integrative function in maintaining financial stability and regulatory compliance [Data: Entities (5); Relationships (56, 906, 202, 810, 854, 855, 856, 857, 1166, 1167, 1178, 1314, 1315, 1316, 102, 104, 115, 131, 759, 761, 808, 809, 820, 821, 823, 824, 852, 862, 901, 902, 903, 904, 907, 908, 910, 911, 925, 1071, 1196)]\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"summary\": \"Oversight and Governance by the Risk Management Committee\",\n      \"explanation\": \"The Risk Management Committee functions as a specialized board committee within Authorized Institutions responsible for overseeing the implementation and maintenance of the Risk Management System.

Quantitative tools include risk models, internal rating systems, stress testing, sensitivity analysis, variance analysis, and capital charge calculations, which provide measurable and data-driven insights into risk exposures. Complementing these are qualitative approaches that rely on expert judgment and critical analysis to address conceptual limitations of models and to evaluate new or emerging risks. This dual approach enhances the robustness and forward-looking nature of risk assessments within AIs [Data: Entities (367, 382, 387, 385, 366, 365); Relationships (810, 855, 856, 857, 907, 908)]\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"summary\": \"Robust Policies, Procedures, and Limit Structures as Foundations of Risk Control\",\n      \"explanation\": \"A fundamental component of the RMS is the establishment of comprehensive policies, procedures, and limit structures that govern risk-taking activities.
