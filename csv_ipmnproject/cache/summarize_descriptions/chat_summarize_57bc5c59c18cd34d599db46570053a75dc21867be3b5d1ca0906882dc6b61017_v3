These limits are designed to ensure that the level of risk taken remains within acceptable bounds, aligning with the institution's overall risk appetite. The risk limits serve as controls that define the maximum level of risk an organization is willing to accept across different areas of its operations, thereby facilitating compliance with regulatory requirements. By implementing these defined thresholds, AIs can effectively manage their risk exposure, ensuring that their operations adhere to established risk appetite frameworks and maintain operational integrity.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 126, "prompt_tokens": 457, "total_tokens": 583, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
