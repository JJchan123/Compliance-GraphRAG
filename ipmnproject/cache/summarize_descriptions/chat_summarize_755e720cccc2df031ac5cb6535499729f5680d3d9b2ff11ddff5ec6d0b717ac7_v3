This illicit activity poses a significant threat to financial systems, as it undermines the integrity of financial institutions and can facilitate further criminal activities. By disguising the origins of illegally acquired funds, money laundering enables criminals to enjoy the benefits of their illegal gains without attracting attention from law enforcement or regulatory bodies.
