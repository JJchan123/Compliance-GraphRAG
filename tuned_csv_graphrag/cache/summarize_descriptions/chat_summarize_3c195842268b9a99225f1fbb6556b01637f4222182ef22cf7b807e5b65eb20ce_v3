These limits are set either by an AI system or by an authorized institution and are designed to manage various measurable risks arising from business activities, including credit risk, market risk, interest rate risk, and liquidity risk. Additionally, risk limits address risk concentration by limiting exposures to specific borrowers, asset types, or particular business activities. To ensure effective governance and compliance, risk limits must be formally documented and approved by the institution’s Board of Directors or its designated committees, thereby integrating risk management practices with the overall strategic objectives of the organization.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 130, "prompt_tokens": 347, "total_tokens": 477, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
