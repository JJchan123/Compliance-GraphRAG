This profile serves as a crucial document that encapsulates the various risks associated with artificial intelligence (AI) systems. It is developed through a systematic risk assessment exercise, which aims to identify and analyze the potential risks that these AI systems may pose.\n\nThe risk profile not only highlights the inherent risks linked to AI but also plays a significant role in determining the intensity of supervision that these institutions will face. The findings from the risk profile influence the supervisory actions taken by the HKMA, ensuring that appropriate measures are implemented to mitigate identified risks. This comprehensive approach allows for a better understanding of the risk landscape associated with AI technologies, thereby facilitating more effective risk management and regulatory oversight.\n\nIn summary, the RISK PROFILE is an essential tool for assessing and managing the risks associated with AI systems within authorized institutions, guiding the supervisory framework established by the HKMA.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 203, "prompt_tokens": 219, "total_tokens": 422, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
