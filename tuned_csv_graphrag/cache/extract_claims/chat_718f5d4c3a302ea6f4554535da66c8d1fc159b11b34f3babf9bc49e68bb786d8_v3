Where deficiencies in an individual AI’s AML/CFT Systems are identified, the HKMA will write to the AI’s Chief Executive, and its Board of Directors where appropriate, to ensure that the AI understands what the deficiencies are, the remedial actions which must be undertaken, and the timeframe within which those actions must be completed. The HKMA will follow up with the AI concerned on the timely implementation of remedial actions, and that the identified deficiencies are effectively addressed. Where appropriate, the HKMA will require the AI to provide independent validation of the completion and effectiveness of the remedial actions taken.”)\n##\n(HKMA<|>AI<|>ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS<|>TRUE<|>NONE<|>NONE<|>HKMA may commence investigations and take enforcement actions if there is reasonable cause to believe an offence under the AMLO has been committed by an AI, with enforcement actions proportionate to the seriousness of deficiencies found to deter abuse of the banking system for ML/TF activities.<|>“If there is reason to inquire whether a specified provision under the AMLO has been contravened or if there is reasonable cause to believe that an offence under the AMLO may have been committed, an investigation may be commenced by the HKMA. If contraventions of the AMLO are identified, enforcement actions will be taken that are commensurate with, and proportionate to, the deficiencies found. The principal objectives of enforcement actions are to deter abuse of the banking system for ML/TF activities, drive changes and reinforce the important message that banks must have AML/CFT Systems that are commensurate with the risks presented.”)\n<|COMPLETE|>", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 459, "prompt_tokens": 1582, "total_tokens": 2041, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 1152, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
