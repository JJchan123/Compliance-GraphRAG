This process is essential for effective risk management and compliance with regulatory standards, particularly in relation to money laundering and terrorist financing, as mandated by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA). \n\nRISK ASSESSMENT serves as a critical component of a robust risk management framework, informing the supervisory approach of the HKMA by systematically evaluating risks to determine their potential impact and likelihood. It involves coordinated efforts to minimize, monitor, and control the probability or impact of adverse events, thereby ensuring that AIs can effectively navigate the complexities of their business activities while adhering to regulatory requirements. Overall, RISK ASSESSMENT is integral to maintaining compliance and enhancing the resilience of organizations against various risks.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 178, "prompt_tokens": 489, "total_tokens": 667, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
