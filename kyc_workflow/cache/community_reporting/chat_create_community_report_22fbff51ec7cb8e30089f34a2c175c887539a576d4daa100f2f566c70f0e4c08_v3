Senior management holds a central role in approving exceptions to standard CDD, overseeing high risk customer acceptance and enhanced due diligence, and sanctioning business relationships with politically exposed persons (PEPs). The relationships highlight a structured governance framework where senior management ensures compliance with AML/CFT policies through documented risk-based approaches and approval processes. Exceptions to CDD requirements are permitted under specific conditions but require senior management approval and proper documentation, ensuring risk mitigation.
