This risk management rating, assigned during on-site examinations and through the broader supervisory process, plays a critical role in evaluating an institution’s management quality. It not only directly influences the management component but may also impact other elements of the CAMEL rating, thereby affecting the overall supervisory assessment of financial institutions.
