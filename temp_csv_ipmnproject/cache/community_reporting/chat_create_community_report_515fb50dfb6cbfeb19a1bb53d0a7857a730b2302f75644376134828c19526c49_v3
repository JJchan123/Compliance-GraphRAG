These risks are credit risk, market risk, interest rate risk, liquidity risk, operational risk, reputation risk, legal risk, and strategic risk. Each risk category represents a fundamental exposure intrinsic to the business activities of AIs and is systematically assessed during the supervisory process to determine the overall risk profile of each institution. This comprehensive framework ensures that AIs maintain robust risk management practices aligned with regulatory standards, thereby contributing to the stability and integrity of the financial system [Data: INHERENT RISKS (8), EIGHT INHERENT RISKS (47), CREDIT RISK (9), LIQUIDITY RISK (12), OPERATIONAL RISK (13), REPUTATION RISK (14), LEGAL RISK (15), STRATEGIC RISK (16)].\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"summary\": \"Credit Risk is a Central Component of the HKMA’s Supervisory Focus\",\n      \"explanation\": \"Credit risk, defined as the risk of financial loss from a borrower or counterparty failing to meet contractual debt obligations, is a critical focus area within the HKMA’s supervisory framework. It involves evaluating asset quality, lending limits, underwriting standards, and provisioning adequacy to mitigate potential losses. The HKMA requires AIs to implement comprehensive credit risk assessment systems to monitor and control exposure effectively. Additionally, emerging factors such as climate risk can exacerbate credit risk by disrupting borrowers’ ability to repay, highlighting the need for dynamic risk management approaches. The close relationship between credit risk and the broader inherent risks underscores its significance in regulatory compliance and risk management [Data: CREDIT RISK (9), INHERENT RISKS (8), CLIMATE RISK (342), RELATIONSHIPS (54, 733, 16, 1223)].\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"summary\": \"Liquidity Risk Management is Vital for Meeting Short-Term Financial Obligations\",\n      \"explanation\": \"Liquidity risk, encompassing both funding liquidity risk and market liquidity risk, poses a significant threat to AIs' ability to meet short-term financial obligations. Funding liquidity risk arises when an AI cannot liquidate assets or obtain necessary funding, while market liquidity risk occurs when the AI cannot unwind exposures without adversely affecting market prices due to inadequate market depth or disruptions. The HKMA emphasizes managing liquidity risk through setting risk limits, stress testing, and continuous monitoring within the institution’s overall risk management framework. Effective liquidity risk management ensures that AIs maintain operational stability and comply with regulatory requirements [Data: LIQUIDITY RISK (12), MARKET LIQUIDITY RISK (341), RELATIONSHIPS (705, 710)].\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"summary\": \"Operational Risk Arises from Internal Failures and External Events Impacting AIs\",\n      \"explanation\": \"Operational risk is inherent in the internal processes, people, systems, or external events that may cause losses or disrupt the operations of Authorized Institutions. The HKMA’s assessment of operational risk includes factors such as market maturity, transaction volume, system capacity, and the extent of manual intervention. This risk is integrated into the AI’s overall risk profile and is managed through risk management reporting and controls. Effective operational risk management is essential for maintaining compliance, ensuring business continuity, and minimizing disruptions within the financial sector [Data: OPERATIONAL RISK (13), RELATIONSHIPS (713)].\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"summary\": \"Reputation Risk is Influenced by Legal Issues and Market Sentiment\",\n      \"explanation\": \"Reputation risk, defined as the potential loss resulting from negative public opinion or adverse perception, is closely linked to legal risk and market sentiment. Legal challenges such as lawsuits or regulatory breaches can generate negative publicity, thereby increasing reputation risk for AIs. Additionally, evolving factors like climate risk influence consumer and market preferences, potentially exacerbating reputation risk. The HKMA recognizes reputation risk as a critical component of an AI’s risk profile, necessitating its inclusion in risk assessments and reporting frameworks to safeguard the institution’s standing and customer base [Data: REPUTATION RISK (14), LEGAL RISK (15), CLIMATE RISK (342), RELATIONSHIPS (715)].\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"summary\": \"Legal Risk Impacts Compliance and Strategic Positioning of Authorized Institutions\",\n      \"explanation\": \"Legal risk encompasses potential losses arising from legal actions, contract enforcement uncertainties, and non-compliance with laws and regulations. It is a significant factor affecting the operational stability and financial condition of AIs. The HKMA includes legal risk within its supervisory and risk management framework, emphasizing its importance in maintaining regulatory compliance. Furthermore, legal risk can influence strategic risk by affecting business decisions and operational execution, thereby impacting the AI’s overall risk profile and strategic positioning in the market [Data: LEGAL RISK (15), STRATEGIC RISK (16), RELATIONSHIPS (719, 715)].\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"summary\": \"Strategic Risk Reflects the Impact of Business Decisions and Market Adaptation\",\n      \"explanation\": \"Strategic risk arises from adverse business decisions, ineffective strategy implementation, or failure to adapt to changes in the industry, economic environment, or technology. This risk affects earnings, capital, reputation, and the overall standing of Authorized Institutions. The HKMA requires AIs to align their strategic goals with resource deployment and risk appetite to manage this risk effectively. Activities such as mergers and acquisitions represent strategic risks that necessitate thorough assessment to ensure they do not adversely affect the institution’s risk profile [Data: STRATEGIC RISK (16), MERGERS AND ACQUISITIONS (468), RELATIONSHIPS (722, 1014)].\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"summary\": \"Climate Risk is an Emerging Factor Affecting Multiple Inherent Risks\",\n      \"explanation\": \"Climate risk, encompassing risks from climate change and environmental factors, is an emerging risk that impacts several inherent risks faced by AIs, including credit risk and reputation risk. It can cause business disruptions that impair borrowers’ repayment abilities and influence market and consumer sentiment towards sustainable products and practices. The HKMA acknowledges climate risk as a factor that can exacerbate traditional risks, necessitating its integration into risk management and supervisory frameworks to enhance early detection and proactive management [Data: CLIMATE RISK (342), RELATIONSHIPS (733, 715)].\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"summary\": \"Risk Management Reports and Senior Management Oversight are Crucial for Compliance\",\n      \"explanation\": \"Risk management reports serve as vital tools for monitoring and controlling inherent risks within Authorized Institutions.
