It employs a risk-based supervisory approach that integrates both qualitative and quantitative analyses to monitor and assess the safety and soundness of AIs, including their risk profiles and management systems, through a forward-looking and dynamic supervisory process.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AUTHORIZED INSTITUTION<|>AUTHORIZED INSTITUTION<|>Authorized Institutions (AIs) are financial institutions licensed and regulated by the HKMA. They are subject to ongoing supervision and assessment using the risk-based supervisory approach, including evaluation of their financial condition, risk management systems, and exposure to eight inherent risk types.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RISK-BASED SUPERVISORY APPROACH<|>SUPERVISORY PROCESS<|>The risk-based supervisory approach is a methodology used by the HKMA that emphasizes effective planning and examiner judgment, customizing examinations according to the size and activities of AIs. It focuses supervisory resources on areas of greatest risk, combining qualitative and quantitative analyses to produce a comprehensive risk profile and influence CAMEL ratings.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CAMEL RATING SYSTEM<|>SUPERVISORY PROCESS<|>The CAMEL rating system is a supervisory tool implemented by the HKMA since 1995 to assess an AI's financial condition, compliance with laws and regulations, risk management systems, and overall operating soundness. The system incorporates risk-based supervision elements, including risk management ratings derived from on-site examinations.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CREDIT RISK<|>RISK TYPE<|>Credit risk is one of the eight inherent risks identified by the HKMA, representing the risk of loss due to a borrower's failure to meet contractual obligations or deterioration in asset quality, which can affect an AI's financial condition and CAMEL rating.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MARKET RISK<|>RISK TYPE<|>Market risk is an inherent risk type involving potential losses arising from movements in market prices or rates, identified by the HKMA as one of the eight risks to be assessed during supervision.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>INTEREST RATE RISK<|>RISK TYPE<|>Interest rate risk is the risk of adverse effects on an AI's financial condition due to changes in interest rates, recognized by the HKMA as one of the eight inherent risks.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LIQUIDITY RISK<|>RISK TYPE<|>Liquidity risk is the risk that an AI will be unable to meet its financial obligations as they fall due without incurring unacceptable losses, identified as one of the eight inherent risks by the HKMA.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>OPERATIONAL RISK<|>RISK TYPE<|>Operational risk refers to potential losses resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people, systems, or external events, recognized by the HKMA as one of the eight inherent risks.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LEGAL RISK<|>RISK TYPE<|>Legal risk involves potential losses due to legal actions, non-compliance with laws or regulations, or contractual failures, identified by the HKMA as one of the eight inherent risks.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>REPUTATION RISK<|>RISK TYPE<|>Reputation risk is the risk of loss resulting from damage to an AI's reputation, affecting its ability to maintain or establish business relationships, one of the eight inherent risks identified by the HKMA.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>STRATEGIC RISK<|>RISK TYPE<|>Strategic risk is the risk arising from adverse business decisions, improper implementation of decisions, or failure to respond to industry changes, identified by the HKMA as one of the eight inherent risks.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RISK MANAGEMENT RATING<|>SUPERVISORY PROCESS<|>The risk management rating is an assessment assigned by the HKMA based on the quality of an AI's risk management systems and internal controls, derived from on-site examinations and incorporated into the management component of the CAMEL rating.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HKMA<|>AUTHORIZED INSTITUTION<|>The HKMA supervises Authorized Institutions using a risk-based supervisory approach to ensure their safety and soundness through ongoing assessment and examination.<|>10)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HKMA<|>RISK-BASED SUPERVISORY APPROACH<|>The HKMA employs the risk-based supervisory approach as its core methodology for supervising Authorized Institutions, focusing on risk profiles and management systems.<|>10)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>RISK-BASED SUPERVISORY APPROACH<|>CAMEL RATING SYSTEM<|>The risk-based supervisory approach integrates qualitative risk profile analyses into the CAMEL rating system to provide a forward-looking and comprehensive assessment of Authorized Institutions.<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CAMEL RATING SYSTEM<|>AUTHORIZED INSTITUTION<|>The CAMEL rating system assesses the financial condition, compliance, risk management, and overall soundness of Authorized Institutions.<|>10)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>AUTHORIZED INSTITUTION<|>RISK TYPE<|>Authorized Institutions are evaluated for exposure to eight inherent risk types identified by the HKMA, including credit, market, interest rate, liquidity, operational, legal, reputation, and strategic risks.<|>10)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>RISK MANAGEMENT RATING<|>CAMEL RATING SYSTEM<|>The risk management rating assigned during on-site examinations is incorporated into the management component of the CAMEL rating, influencing the overall supervisory assessment.<|>10)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>RISK-BASED SUPERVISORY APPROACH<|>RISK MANAGEMENT RATING<|>The risk-based supervisory approach emphasizes evaluating the quality of risk management systems and internal controls, which forms the basis for assigning the risk management rating.<|>9)\n<|COMPLETE|>", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 1248, "prompt_tokens": 6207, "total_tokens": 7455, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
