This process is essential for determining the appropriate level of supervisory engagement required for each institution. By employing risk profiling, the HKMA evaluates the specific ML/TF risks associated with each AI, which in turn guides its supervisory approach. This systematic assessment ensures that the HKMA can effectively allocate resources and tailor its oversight to enhance compliance with regulatory standards in the financial sector.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 108, "prompt_tokens": 280, "total_tokens": 388, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
