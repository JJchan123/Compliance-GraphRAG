It conducts continuous supervisory processes including risk-focused on-site examinations, prudential meetings with senior management, and meetings with boards of directors to ensure the safety and soundness of AIs and effective risk management.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AUTHORIZED INSTITUTION<|>AUTHORIZED INSTITUTION<|>Authorized Institutions (AIs) are financial institutions regulated by the HKMA. They undergo continuous supervision including risk-focused on-site examinations, annual prudential meetings with senior management, and meetings involving their boards of directors to address risk management and prudential concerns.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>INTERNAL AUDIT FUNCTION<|>INTERNAL AUDIT FUNCTION<|>The internal audit function within an AI provides independent assurance on the effectiveness of the institution’s risk management systems and controls. If the internal audit function meets HKMA standards, the HKMA places greater reliance on its work, potentially reducing the scope of on-site examinations.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SENIOR MANAGEMENT<|>SENIOR MANAGEMENT<|>Senior management of an AI participates in annual prudential meetings with the HKMA as part of the continuous supervisory process. These meetings enable dialogue on risk control, business outlook, and prudential concerns, facilitating better supervisory understanding and communication.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BOARD OF DIRECTORS<|>BOARD OF DIRECTORS<|>The board of directors of locally-incorporated banks holds annual meetings with the HKMA, typically after risk-focused on-site examinations. These meetings serve to discuss supervisory findings, risk management, and prudential issues, enhancing governance and oversight.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PRUDENTIAL MEETING<|>SUPERVISORY PROCESS<|>Annual prudential meetings are held between the HKMA and the senior management of AIs to discuss risk management perspectives, business conditions, and prudential concerns as part of the continuous supervisory process.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RISK-FOCUSED ON-SITE EXAMINATION<|>SUPERVISORY PROCESS<|>Risk-focused on-site examinations are conducted by the HKMA to assess the risk management systems and controls of AIs. The scope of these examinations may be reduced if the internal audit function is deemed acceptable and reliable.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ANNUAL TRIPARTITE MEETING<|>SUPERVISORY PROCESS<|>Annual tripartite meetings involve the HKMA, AIs, and their external auditors, typically after the annual audit. These meetings address audit findings, internal control weaknesses, provisions adequacy, compliance with prudential standards, and issues raised in auditors’ management letters.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BANKING GROUP<|>FINANCIAL SECTOR STAKEHOLDER<|>Banking groups consist of multiple AIs.
