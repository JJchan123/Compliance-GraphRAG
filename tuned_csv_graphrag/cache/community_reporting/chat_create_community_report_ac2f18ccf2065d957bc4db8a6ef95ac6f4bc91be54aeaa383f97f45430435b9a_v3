The key entities include ML/TF Risk itself, the International Financial Centre (IFC) status of Hong Kong, and the introduction of New Technology by AIs. The relationships highlight how Hong Kong's position as an international financial hub influences the complexity and nature of ML/TF risks, while innovations in technology by AIs can alter their risk profiles, necessitating supervisory reassessment.
