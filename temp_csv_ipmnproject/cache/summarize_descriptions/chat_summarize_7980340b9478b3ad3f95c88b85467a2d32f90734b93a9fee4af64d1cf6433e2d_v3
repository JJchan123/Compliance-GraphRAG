The CRO is responsible for ensuring prompt and effective action when material risk exposures approach or exceed the AI’s approved risk appetite and limits. This executive participates actively in key decision-making processes, including strategic planning, capital and liquidity planning, new product approvals, and remuneration design, while also setting risk-related performance indicators for business units.\n\nTo fulfill these responsibilities, the CRO must possess relevant skills and experience commensurate with the AI’s business complexity and maintain sufficient independence and authority to challenge risk-related decisions. The CRO has unfettered access to all necessary information and operates with duties distinct from other executive functions, specifically without management or financial responsibilities over business lines or revenue-generating functions. This structural independence ensures objective oversight and effective risk governance.\n\nReporting directly to the AI’s Chief Executive and the Board or its Risk Committee, the CRO plays a pivotal role in communicating the AI’s evolving risk profile, ensuring adherence to the approved risk appetite, and prompting timely action on material risk exposures. Additionally, the CRO holds holistic oversight of risks associated with new products and services, actively monitoring and participating in the approval process for new or significantly changed offerings. This includes maintaining a centralized list of approved products and services, ensuring proper classification, and formal approval of all initiatives to safeguard the institution’s risk posture.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 287, "prompt_tokens": 481, "total_tokens": 768, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
