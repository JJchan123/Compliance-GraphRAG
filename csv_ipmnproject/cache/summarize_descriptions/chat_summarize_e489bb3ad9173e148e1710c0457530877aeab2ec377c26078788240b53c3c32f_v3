This risk can stem from two primary sources: funding liquidity risk, which relates to the availability of funds, and market liquidity risk, which pertains to the ease of converting assets into cash without significant loss. According to the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA), liquidity risk is one of the eight inherent risks that AIs are required to assess and manage. It arises from an imbalance between liquid assets and liabilities, making it a critical area of focus in risk management practices. Furthermore, liquidity risk is recognized as a material risk that should be thoroughly addressed in risk management reports, highlighting its significance in maintaining financial stability and compliance with regulatory standards.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 156, "prompt_tokens": 510, "total_tokens": 666, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
