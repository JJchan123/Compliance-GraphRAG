Central to the ecosystem is the Board of Directors, which holds primary responsibility for approving and overseeing risk management policies, including the Risk Appetite Framework (RAF), capital and financial plans, and ensuring compliance with regulatory guidelines such as CG-1 and CG-5. The Board delegates specific risk oversight tasks to specialized Board-level committees and ensures the independence and competence of risk management and control functions. The risk governance framework integrates stress testing, scenario analyses, and continuous monitoring of risk exposures, supported by regular communication mechanisms. External supervisory engagement is exemplified by the HKMA's annual board meetings with locally incorporated banks to discuss prudential concerns. The ecosystem also includes internal audit functions providing independent assurance on risk governance effectiveness, and the embedding of AML/CFT considerations within the broader risk management framework. Overall, the community reflects a comprehensive, multi-layered governance and supervisory structure aimed at robust financial compliance and risk mitigation.\",\n  \"findings\": [\n    {\n      \"summary\": \"Board of Directors as the central governance authority\",\n      \"explanation\": \"The Board of Directors is the pivotal entity in the governance and risk management ecosystem of Authorized Institutions. It holds ultimate responsibility for approving and overseeing the implementation of the Risk Management Policy, the Risk Appetite Statement, and ensuring alignment with the institution’s strategic objectives and regulatory requirements. The Board actively reviews and enforces risk controls, including those related to new product approvals, and promotes regular and transparent communication mechanisms within the institution to support effective risk governance. It also ensures that capital and financial plans are formulated in accordance with the risk appetite framework and considers changes in the external environment when making strategic decisions. This central role is supported by the Board’s delegation of specific risk oversight responsibilities to specialized Board-level committees, which report regularly to the Board, thereby enabling focused and expert risk management oversight [Data: Entities (17, 44, 416, 420, 423, 426, 414, 430), Relationships (69, 902, 197, 896, 911, 914, 917, 929, 932, 933)].\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"summary\": \"Risk Appetite Framework as the cornerstone of risk governance\",\n      \"explanation\": \"The Risk Appetite Framework (RAF) is a formal structure established and approved by the Board and senior management that defines the types and levels of risk the AI is willing to accept. It includes qualitative and quantitative elements such as risk appetite statements, risk limits, and monitoring indicators. The RAF guides the setting, monitoring, and enforcement of risk limits, ensuring risk-taking aligns with strategic goals and regulatory expectations. It incorporates forward-looking assessments through stress testing and scenario analyses to inform management actions and recovery plans. The RAF is embedded institution-wide, fostering a strong risk culture and serving as a benchmark for new product approvals. The Board and senior management drive the RAF, ensuring its integration into the institution’s risk culture and continuous review [Data: Entities (44, 416, 419, 419, 419), Relationships (902, 419, 907, 927)].\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"summary\": \"Specialized Board-level committees enhance risk oversight\",\n      \"explanation\": \"The Board of Directors delegates specific risk management responsibilities to specialized Board-level committees, such as the Asset and Liability Management Committee, which reviews the adequacy and effectiveness of the AI’s risk management system. These committees operate under clear mandates and submit regular reports to the Board, facilitating focused oversight on critical risk areas. The Risk Committee, often chaired by an Independent Non-Executive Director, ensures independent and expert supervision of risk management activities.

These analyses support the assessment of risk appetite and help management understand potential impacts of risk exposures, informing risk mitigation strategies and recovery planning.
