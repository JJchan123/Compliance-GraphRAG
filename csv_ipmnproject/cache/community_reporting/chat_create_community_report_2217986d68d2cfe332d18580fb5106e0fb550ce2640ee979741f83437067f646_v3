This approach emphasizes identifying and focusing on areas of greatest risk, particularly in relation to Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Counter-Financing of Terrorism (CFT) compliance. By concentrating on these high-risk areas, the HKMA aims to ensure not only compliance with regulatory standards but also the overall stability of the banking sector. This framework is crucial for guiding supervisory efforts and optimizing resource allocation to high-risk areas.
