Its primary objective is to ensure that AIs comply with relevant laws and regulations, thereby minimizing potential legal liabilities. Additionally, the HKMA evaluates legal risk to confirm that AIs operate within enforceable contracts and are adequately prepared to address any potential legal challenges that may arise.
