The key entities include the Supervisory Framework, Supervisory Process, and Risk-Based Supervision (RBA). The Supervisory Framework establishes the structured process for monitoring AIs, encompassing the Supervisory Process which involves risk assessments, on-site and off-site examinations, and supervisory engagements. Risk-Based Supervision underpins the methodology, guiding the intensity and focus of supervisory activities proportional to the ML/TF risks posed by different banking segments and individual AIs. The HKMA actively applies this approach to ensure robust governance, risk management, and regulatory compliance within the authorized banking institutions under its jurisdiction.\",\n  \"findings\": [\n    {\n      \"summary\": \"HKMA's adoption of Risk-Based Approach (RBA) as foundational AML/CFT supervisory principle\",\n      \"explanation\": \"The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) adopts the Risk-Based Approach (RBA) as the foundational principle for its AML/CFT supervisory activities. This approach allows the HKMA to allocate supervisory resources and attention proportionally to the money laundering and terrorist financing risks posed by different banking sector segments and individual Authorized Institutions (AIs).
