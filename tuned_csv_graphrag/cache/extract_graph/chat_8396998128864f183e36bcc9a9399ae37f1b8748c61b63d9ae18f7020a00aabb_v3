It employs a risk-based supervisory approach that customizes examinations based on the size and activities of AIs, focusing supervisory resources on areas that expose the AI to the greatest degree of risk.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AUTHORIZED INSTITUTION<|>AUTHORIZED INSTITUTION<|>An Authorized Institution (AI) is a financial institution licensed and regulated by the HKMA. The AI’s structure, financial condition, business lines, functions, strategy, and affiliated entities are assessed as part of ongoing supervision to ensure safety and soundness.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RISK-BASED SUPERVISORY APPROACH<|>SUPERVISORY PROCESS<|>The risk-based supervisory approach is a methodology used by the HKMA that involves six key steps, including understanding the AI through an Institutional Overview, assessing risks via a Risk Assessment Narrative, and planning supervisory work. It focuses on identifying and managing the types, levels, and directions of risks to concentrate supervisory efforts on the highest risk areas.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>INSTITUTIONAL OVERVIEW<|>SUPERVISORY PROCESS<|>The Institutional Overview is a document prepared as the first step in the risk-based supervisory approach. It provides a concise portrait of an AI’s structure, financial condition, key business lines, functions, business strategy, planned new products, legal structure, and identifies problem issues related to the AI or its affiliates such as subsidiaries and branches.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RISK ASSESSMENT NARRATIVE<|>SUPERVISORY PROCESS<|>The Risk Assessment Narrative is the output of the second step in the risk-based supervisory approach. It identifies the type, level, and direction of risks faced by an AI by assessing each significant activity against inherent risks and the adequacy of risk management systems in place.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RISK PROFILE<|>RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK<|>The risk profile is a comprehensive summary developed from the risk assessment exercise, capturing all eight types of inherent risks of an AI. It is used to guide planning and supervisory activities tailored to the AI’s risk exposure.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RISK MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS<|>RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK<|>Risk management systems refer to the controls, policies, and procedures an AI has in place to manage and mitigate the inherent risks identified during the risk assessment process.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HKMA<|>RISK-BASED SUPERVISORY APPROACH<|>The HKMA employs the risk-based supervisory approach as its methodology to supervise authorized institutions, focusing on risk identification and management to allocate supervisory resources effectively.<|>10)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>RISK-BASED SUPERVISORY APPROACH<|>INSTITUTIONAL OVERVIEW<|>The risk-based supervisory approach begins with preparing an Institutional Overview to understand the AI’s structure and risk context.<|>10)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>RISK-BASED SUPERVISORY APPROACH<|>RISK ASSESSMENT NARRATIVE<|>The risk-based supervisory approach includes completing a Risk Assessment Narrative to identify and evaluate the risks faced by the AI.<|>10)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>RISK ASSESSMENT NARRATIVE<|>RISK PROFILE<|>The Risk Assessment Narrative is used to develop a comprehensive risk profile summarizing the AI’s inherent risks.<|>10)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>RISK PROFILE<|>RISK MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS<|>The risk profile assesses the adequacy of the AI’s risk management systems in managing identified risks.<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>RISK PROFILE<|>AUTHORIZED INSTITUTION<|>The risk profile reflects the overall risk exposure of the authorized institution and guides supervisory planning.<|>10)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>INSTITUTIONAL OVERVIEW<|>AUTHORIZED INSTITUTION<|>The Institutional Overview provides detailed information about the authorized institution’s structure, business, and financial condition.<|>10)\n<|COMPLETE|>", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 878, "prompt_tokens": 6215, "total_tokens": 7093, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 3840, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
