This risk can stem from various factors, including funding liquidity risk and market liquidity risk, and is characterized by an imbalance between liquid assets and liabilities. It is a critical concern that must be managed through appropriate risk limits and is one of the eight inherent risks identified by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA). The assessment of liquidity risk is essential, especially when considering new products or services, as it plays a significant role in the supervisory process and compliance with regulatory standards. AIs are required to actively manage this risk in accordance with HKMA guidelines to ensure financial stability and operational integrity.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 148, "prompt_tokens": 530, "total_tokens": 678, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
