It plays a critical role in managing compliance-related risks and supporting the overall risk management and internal control frameworks. This function oversees compliance with statutory provisions, regulatory requirements—including anti-money laundering (AML), counter-terrorist financing (CFT), sanctions compliance—and codes of conduct relevant to the institution’s banking or regulated activities.\n\nThe Compliance Function assists senior management and the Board by implementing and maintaining the compliance policy, which documents the structure, responsibilities, and measures to manage compliance risk effectively. It provides ongoing monitoring, advice, training, and reporting on compliance matters, ensuring that new products and services comply with regulatory and internal standards before launch. The function operates as the second line of defense within the institution’s governance framework, distinct from but complementary to internal audit, which periodically reviews its effectiveness.\n\nTo perform its duties effectively, the Compliance Function must be adequately resourced with competent, independent staff led by a Head of Compliance whose appointment requires Board or designated committee approval. It must have appropriate authority, standing, and unrestricted access to all necessary records and information within the institution. Where internal resources are insufficient, certain compliance tasks may be outsourced, but these remain under the oversight and responsibility of the Head of Compliance.\n\nOverall, the Compliance Function ensures the integrity of the institution’s compliance framework, mitigates compliance risks, supports the institution’s control environment, and helps maintain regulatory and reputational standards essential for sound governance and financial crime prevention.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 319, "prompt_tokens": 970, "total_tokens": 1289, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
