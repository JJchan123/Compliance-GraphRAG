These limits are derived from the institution’s risk appetite statement and are designed to control exposures to various risk types, including credit risk, market risk, interest rate risk, liquidity risk, and risk concentrations related to specific borrowers, asset types, or business activities. Risk Limits ensure that risk-taking remains consistent with the AI’s overall business strategies and regulatory standards. They are monitored by the risk management function, with the Chief Risk Officer responsible for ensuring prompt action, escalation, and reporting when exposures approach or breach these thresholds. The establishment and approval of Risk Limits typically involve the Board or its committees, enabling effective aggregation and disaggregation of risk exposures and maintaining the institution’s risk profile within acceptable boundaries.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 175, "prompt_tokens": 563, "total_tokens": 738, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
