It focuses on five key components: capital adequacy, asset quality, management quality, earnings, and liquidity. Each of these components plays a crucial role in evaluating the overall health and stability of a financial institution.\n\nCapital adequacy refers to the financial institution's ability to meet its obligations and absorb potential losses, ensuring that it has sufficient capital reserves. Asset quality assesses the quality of the institution's assets, including the risk of default and the overall performance of its loan portfolio. Management quality evaluates the effectiveness and competence of the institution's management team in making sound financial decisions and maintaining operational efficiency.\n\nEarnings reflect the institution's profitability and its ability to generate income, which is essential for sustaining operations and supporting growth. Lastly, liquidity measures the institution's capacity to meet short-term obligations and manage cash flow effectively.\n\nOverall, the CAMEL rating system provides a structured approach to evaluating the soundness of financial institutions by analyzing these critical components, thereby offering insights into their financial health and operational effectiveness.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 217, "prompt_tokens": 332, "total_tokens": 549, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
