Key entities include financial institutions, senior management and boards within these institutions, AML/CFT systems, and regulatory requirements. The HKMA engages directly with senior management and boards to discuss AML/CFT risks and supervises financial institutions to ensure adherence to regulatory standards. AML/CFT systems encompass critical components such as customer due diligence, suspicious transaction monitoring, and enhanced due diligence for higher-risk cases.
