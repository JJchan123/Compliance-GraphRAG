This risk can significantly impact the operations and strategic decisions of an Authorized Institution (AI). It encompasses various aspects, including the potential for unenforceable contracts, lawsuits, or adverse judgments that may disrupt or negatively affect the financial condition of an AI.\n\nAccording to the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA), legal risk is classified as one of the eight inherent risks that AIs must actively manage and report on. This includes the necessity for AIs to monitor and address uncertainties in legal documentation and regulatory requirements, particularly in light of major changes that may arise. The effective management of legal risk is crucial for ensuring compliance with regulatory standards and maintaining operational stability within the financial sector.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 161, "prompt_tokens": 552, "total_tokens": 713, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
