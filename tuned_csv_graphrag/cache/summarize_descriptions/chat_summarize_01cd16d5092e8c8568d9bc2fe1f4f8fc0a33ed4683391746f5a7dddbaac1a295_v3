It encompasses potential direct or indirect losses arising from these failures and is recognized by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) as one of the eight inherent risks within financial institutions. The evaluation of operational risk involves consideration of product-specific factors such as product maturity, fund movement requirements, segregation of duties, and market complexity. Additionally, in contexts involving artificial intelligence (AI), operational risk assessment includes factors like audit quality, transaction volume relative to system capacity, complexity of the processing environment, and the extent of manual intervention. This comprehensive understanding of operational risk is essential for effective governance and risk management within financial organizations.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 144, "prompt_tokens": 506, "total_tokens": 650, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
