This includes both quantifiable risks, which can be measured numerically, and non-quantifiable risks, which may be more subjective in nature. The process is critical for identifying and assessing the various risks that an AI may encounter, serving as a foundational element for effective risk management and informed decision-making. By employing these methodologies, organizations can enhance their understanding of potential vulnerabilities and implement strategies to mitigate them, thereby ensuring compliance with regulatory standards and fostering a more resilient operational framework.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 132, "prompt_tokens": 284, "total_tokens": 416, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
