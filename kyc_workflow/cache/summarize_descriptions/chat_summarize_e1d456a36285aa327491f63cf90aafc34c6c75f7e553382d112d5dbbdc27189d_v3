This identification is a critical component of customer due diligence, particularly when payments are made on behalf of the beneficiary. In the context of wire transfers, the beneficiary is the individual or entity receiving funds, and their financial institution is required to record and verify their identity and address, especially for transactions equal to or exceeding HK$8,000. Additionally, the beneficiary’s financial institution may request information about the originator of the funds to comply with Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Counter Financing of Terrorism (CFT) regulatory frameworks.
