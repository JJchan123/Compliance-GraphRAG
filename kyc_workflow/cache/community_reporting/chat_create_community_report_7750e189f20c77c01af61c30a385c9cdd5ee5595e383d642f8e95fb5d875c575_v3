Key entities include customers, various address verification documents such as utility and rates bills, alternative verification methods like home visits, and signature verification procedures. The relationships highlight the critical role of AIs in establishing and maintaining customer relationships through rigorous identity verification and ongoing risk assessment to prevent financial crimes. The ecosystem reflects a structured approach to governance and risk management within the banking sector, emphasizing compliance with regulatory frameworks and supervisory expectations.\",\n  \"findings\": [\n    {\n      \"summary\": \"Central role of Authorized Institutions in customer due diligence and AML/CFT compliance\",\n      \"explanation\": \"Authorized Institutions serve as the primary financial entities responsible for establishing and maintaining business relationships with customers, including beneficial owners. They conduct customer due diligence by verifying identities through risk-based processes and continuously monitor transactions to detect suspicious activities. This central role positions AIs as critical actors in implementing AML/CFT systems and ensuring compliance with HKMA supervisory frameworks.
