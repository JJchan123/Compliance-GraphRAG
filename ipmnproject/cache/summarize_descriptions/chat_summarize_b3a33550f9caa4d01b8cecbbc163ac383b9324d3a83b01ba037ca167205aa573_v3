This type of risk is particularly relevant in the context of artificial intelligence (AI), where the complexities of legal frameworks can lead to uncertainties in contract interpretation and enforcement. Legal risk encompasses the possibility that legal disputes may arise, which could adversely affect the functioning and reliability of AI systems. As such, organizations utilizing AI must be vigilant in managing legal risk to ensure compliance with applicable laws and to mitigate the potential for negative outcomes stemming from legal uncertainties.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 117, "prompt_tokens": 189, "total_tokens": 306, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
