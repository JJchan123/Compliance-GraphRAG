It arises from adverse business decisions, improper implementation of those decisions, or a failure to respond effectively to changes in the industry, economic environment, or technological landscape. This risk reflects the potential current and prospective impacts on an organization’s earnings, capital, reputation, and overall standing. The manifestation of strategic risk is closely linked to the alignment and compatibility between an organization’s strategic goals, the business strategies formulated to achieve these goals, and the resources allocated for their execution. Effective management of strategic risk requires ensuring that business plans are appropriate, well-implemented, and adaptable to evolving external conditions to safeguard the organization’s long-term viability and regulatory compliance.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 155, "prompt_tokens": 632, "total_tokens": 787, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
