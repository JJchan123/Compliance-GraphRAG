Central to the ecosystem are the Boards and senior management of AIs, who bear primary responsibility for overseeing risk profiles, establishing risk appetite frameworks, and ensuring compliance with laws, regulations, and supervisory standards. The internal control environment and system provide the structural and operational foundation for effective risk management, supported by independent internal audit functions. Risk assessment processes, including the identification of emerging risks, are integral to supervisory methodologies, enabling timely evaluation and mitigation of risks. Supervisory actions are taken when deficiencies in controls or compliance are detected, ensuring corrective measures and safeguarding institutional soundness. The relationships among these entities form a comprehensive framework that supports robust governance, risk oversight, and regulatory compliance within the banking sector.\",\n  \"findings\": [\n    {\n      \"summary\": \"Board and Senior Management as the Central Governance Authority\",\n      \"explanation\": \"The Board and senior management of an Authorized Institution hold the primary responsibility for understanding and overseeing the institution's overall risk profile. They ensure effective risk management by maintaining expertise across all material risks, including those from complex products and high-risk activities. Their leadership role includes setting and monitoring the risk appetite, fostering a strong risk culture, and establishing a sound control environment with clear accountability and dedicated resources. They also ensure compliance with applicable laws, regulations, and supervisory standards, and align remuneration systems to promote prudent risk-taking. Their involvement is critical for embedding risk management into the institution's culture and governance framework [Data: Entities (230), Relationships (424, 886, 887, 1163)].\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"summary\": \"Authorized Institutions as the Operational Entities Subject to Supervision\",\n      \"explanation\": \"Authorized Institutions are the primary operational entities within this community, subject to the HKMA's supervisory framework. They implement the risk management frameworks and internal controls established under the guidance of their Boards and senior management. Their risk profiles and compliance status are continuously assessed through formal risk assessment processes, which identify inherent and emerging risks. These institutions must maintain effective internal control environments and systems to support sound operations and regulatory compliance [Data: Relationships (424, 5)].\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"summary\": \"Risk Assessment as a Core Supervisory Process\",\n      \"explanation\": \"Risk assessment is a formal process used by the HKMA to identify and evaluate the types, levels, and directions of risks faced by Authorized Institutions. This includes the evaluation of inherent and emerging risks, enabling early detection and timely management of potential threats to the institution and the banking system. Risk assessment informs supervisory engagement and resource allocation, ensuring that emerging risks are appropriately anticipated and mitigated [Data: Entities (6, 3), Relationships (5, 12)].\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"summary\": \"Internal Control Environment and System as Foundations for Risk Management\",\n      \"explanation\": \"The internal control environment comprises organizational structures, segregation of duties, accountability, and control mechanisms that support effective risk management and governance. The internal control system, supported fully by the Board and senior management, includes delegation of authority, written policies and procedures, segregation of critical functions, and controls over major operational areas. It also encompasses financial accounting, IT, outsourced activities, and compliance controls, including AML/CFT requirements.
