This approach involves conducting variance analysis against annual budgets or business targets while accounting for the risks undertaken and any breaches of established risk limits. The objective is to ensure that business units achieve returns that are commensurate with their risk exposures, thereby preventing incentives for excessive risk-taking and promoting sound risk governance within the institution. By embedding risk factors into performance measurement, Authorized Institutions can more effectively monitor and manage risk-adjusted returns, aligning business activities with the institution’s overall risk appetite and regulatory compliance requirements.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 129, "prompt_tokens": 351, "total_tokens": 480, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
