This role is critical in ensuring compliance with regulatory requirements related to customer verification and risk management. An INTERMEDIARY can be a financial institution regulated by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA), the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC), or the Office of the Commissioner of Insurance (OCI). Alternatively, it may be a professional person legally or professionally registered in Hong Kong—such as a lawyer, auditor, accountant, trust company, or chartered secretary—conducting business within the jurisdiction. The definition also extends to persons operating in equivalent jurisdictions who are financial institutions or professionals (including lawyers, notaries public, auditors, accountants, tax advisors, trust companies, or chartered secretaries) subject to mandatory professional registration, licensing, or regulation recognized by law. These intermediaries must comply with the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) standards and be supervised to ensure adherence to these regulatory and compliance requirements.
