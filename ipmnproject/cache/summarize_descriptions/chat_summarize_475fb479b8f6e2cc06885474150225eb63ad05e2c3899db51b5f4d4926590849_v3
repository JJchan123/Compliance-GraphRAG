These systems are essential for organizations to systematically address potential threats that could impact their operations, financial performance, and overall objectives. By implementing risk management systems, organizations can create a structured approach to risk assessment, enabling them to prioritize risks based on their potential impact and likelihood.\n\nThe primary purpose of risk management systems is to provide a systematic method for organizations to mitigate risks effectively. This involves not only recognizing and evaluating risks but also developing strategies to minimize their effects. These frameworks typically include processes for risk identification, risk analysis, risk evaluation, risk treatment, and ongoing monitoring and review.\n\nIn summary, risk management systems serve as vital tools for organizations, allowing them to navigate uncertainties and safeguard their assets while striving to achieve their goals.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 165, "prompt_tokens": 174, "total_tokens": 339, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
