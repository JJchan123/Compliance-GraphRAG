It oversees the implementation and maintenance of robust risk management and governance frameworks within these institutions, ensuring compliance with the Banking Ordinance, Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing Ordinance (AMLO), and related regulatory requirements. The HKMA sets regulatory standards including capital adequacy and liquidity ratios, and issues comprehensive guidelines and supervisory expectations tailored to the size, nature, and complexity of each AI’s operations.\n\nEmploying a risk-based supervisory approach, the HKMA continuously monitors and assesses the safety and soundness of AIs through a combination of off-site supervision, risk-focused on-site examinations, prudential interviews, and meetings with senior management and boards of directors. This approach integrates qualitative and quantitative analyses, forward-looking risk assessments over a 12-month horizon, and customized supervisory activities that prioritize areas of greatest risk. The HKMA assigns risk management ratings integrated into the CAMEL rating system and requires prompt notification of key compliance appointments, such as the Head of Compliance, within 14 days.\n\nA critical focus of the HKMA’s supervision is the effective implementation of Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT) systems. The HKMA enforces AML/CFT regulations under the AMLO and Banking Ordinance, exercising statutory powers to impose remedial orders, pecuniary penalties, public reprimands, and prosecutions to address deficiencies and ensure compliance. It actively develops policies, issues circulars and guidance papers aligned with international standards, organizes industry seminars, facilitates information sharing on money laundering and terrorist financing risks and typologies, and promotes capacity building and training within the banking sector.\n\nFurthermore, the HKMA collaborates domestically and internationally with other regulatory and law enforcement bodies to strengthen Hong Kong’s AML/CFT regime and safeguard the integrity and stability of the financial system. Through its comprehensive supervisory framework, the HKMA ensures that Authorized Institutions maintain sound risk management practices, effectively mitigate financial crime risks, and uphold the overall safety, soundness, and resilience of Hong Kong’s banking sector.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 441, "prompt_tokens": 2955, "total_tokens": 3396, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
