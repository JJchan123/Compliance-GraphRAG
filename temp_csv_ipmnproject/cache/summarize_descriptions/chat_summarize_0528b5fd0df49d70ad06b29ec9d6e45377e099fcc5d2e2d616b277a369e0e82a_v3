The HKMA promotes effective sharing of information and intelligence with Authorized Institutions to enhance AML/CFT compliance and requires these institutions to maintain robust AML/CFT systems that effectively assess and manage money laundering and terrorist financing risks, including higher-risk scenarios.\n\nIn addition to AML/CFT oversight, the HKMA supervises Authorized Institutions to ensure their overall safety, soundness, and financial stability within the banking sector. This supervision is conducted through a risk-based supervisory framework that includes on-site visitations, prudential interviews, examinations, meetings, and ongoing dialogue to assess and manage the institutions’ risk profiles. The HKMA mandates that Authorized Institutions maintain sound risk management frameworks, systems, and practices that are commensurate with their operational scale and complexity, ensuring effective communication and management of risk information.\n\nThe HKMA’s supervisory approach also encompasses compliance with international sanctions and other regulatory obligations, enforcing prudential standards and risk management requirements to safeguard the financial system. It exercises regulatory powers, including the ability to revoke or suspend authorizations and impose conditions on Authorized Institutions, to uphold compliance and financial soundness. Overall, the HKMA’s comprehensive supervision ensures that Authorized Institutions operate with strong governance, effective risk controls, and adherence to all relevant AML/CFT and banking regulations, thereby maintaining the integrity and stability of Hong Kong’s financial sector.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 315, "prompt_tokens": 875, "total_tokens": 1190, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
