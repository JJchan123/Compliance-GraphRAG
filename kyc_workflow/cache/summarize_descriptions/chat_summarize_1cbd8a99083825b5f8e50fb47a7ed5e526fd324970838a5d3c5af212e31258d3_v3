This risk can materialize when the institution conducts business in jurisdictions that inadequately implement the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) Recommendations or maintain inferior Anti-Money Laundering and Counter Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT) standards, thereby exposing the institution to regulatory and compliance vulnerabilities. Additionally, reputation risk may stem from business relationships with Politically Exposed Persons (PEPs), given the heightened potential for involvement in corruption or illicit activities associated with such individuals. Overall, reputation risk encompasses the threat that these factors pose to the institution’s standing, trustworthiness, and ultimately its financial and operational stability.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 150, "prompt_tokens": 323, "total_tokens": 473, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
