This risk is one of the eight inherent risks that AIs must assess and manage as part of their comprehensive risk management processes. AIs are required to monitor and manage market risk diligently, incorporating it into their risk management systems and policies. This includes establishing limits to mitigate potential losses stemming from fluctuations in market rates or prices, such as foreign exchange rates, commodity prices, or equity prices. Furthermore, market risk must be considered when AIs introduce new products or services, ensuring that they maintain a robust framework to address the challenges posed by market volatility and align with regulatory standards set by the HKMA.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 158, "prompt_tokens": 548, "total_tokens": 706, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
