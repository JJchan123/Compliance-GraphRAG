The SoD framework mandates clear separation among key operational functions including trading operations, custodial operations, back-office operations, loan origination, marketing, and processing. These separations are designed to prevent conflicts of interest, reduce risks of errors and fraud, and strengthen governance and compliance. The relationships among these entities illustrate how SoD is implemented to ensure robust risk management and regulatory adherence within financial institutions.\",\n  \"findings\": [\n    {\n      \"summary\": \"Segregation of Duties as a Core Control Mechanism\",\n      \"explanation\": \"Segregation of duties (SoD) is identified as a fundamental control mechanism within AIs, aimed at enhancing risk management and governance. It establishes clear boundaries between critical functions to prevent conflicts of interest and reduce operational risks such as errors and fraud. By enforcing these separations, SoD supports effective oversight and compliance with regulatory requirements, thereby safeguarding the institution's operational integrity and financial stability. This central role underscores SoD's importance in the overall risk management framework of AIs [Data: Entities (498)].\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"summary\": \"Separation of Trading, Custodial, and Back-Office Operations\",\n      \"explanation\": \"The SoD framework requires that trading operations be segregated from custodial and back-office operations. Trading operations involve business activities that could present conflicts if combined with asset safekeeping (custodial) or administrative support (back-office). Custodial operations focus on asset safekeeping and administration, which must remain independent from trading and back-office functions to ensure effective internal controls. Back-office operations handle settlements and record-keeping, and their segregation from trading and custodial functions maintains control integrity. This triad separation is critical to preventing conflicts of interest and controlling operational risks within AIs [Data: Entities (501, 502, 503); Relationships (1100, 1101, 1102)].\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"summary\": \"Segregation Among Loan Origination, Marketing, and Processing Functions\",\n      \"explanation\": \"Within the credit function, loan origination, marketing, and processing activities must be segregated to prevent conflicts and maintain effective controls. Loan origination involves creating new loans and must be separated from marketing, which promotes products and services, and processing, which handles transaction administration. This separation ensures that no single function can unduly influence or compromise the integrity of loan approval and administration processes, thereby reducing risks of errors, fraud, or regulatory breaches [Data: Entities (504, 505, 506); Relationships (1103, 1104, 1105)].\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"summary\": \"Comprehensive Implementation of Segregation of Duties\",\n      \"explanation\": \"The relationships mapped demonstrate a comprehensive implementation of SoD across multiple operational domains within AIs. Each critical function is distinctly separated from others with which conflicts could arise, reflecting a holistic approach to internal control design. This comprehensive segregation supports the institution's ability to manage risks effectively and comply with supervisory expectations under the HKMA framework, highlighting the community's structured governance and risk mitigation approach [Data: Relationships (1100, 1101, 1102, 1103, 1104, 1105)].\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"summary\": \"Role of Segregation of Duties in Enhancing Regulatory Compliance\",\n      \"explanation\": \"By enforcing segregation of duties, AIs align with regulatory requirements aimed at ensuring robust internal controls and risk management.
