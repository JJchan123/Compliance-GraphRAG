Emerging risks are characterized as new or evolving threats that have the potential to affect the stability of artificial intelligences (AIs). These risks are not only recognized as significant factors but are also integrated into the assessment of inherent risks. The presence of emerging risks can influence the evaluation of inherent risks by introducing new challenges or intensifying existing vulnerabilities. Thus, the relationship between these two types of risks is critical for understanding the overall risk landscape and ensuring robust compliance with regulatory standards.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 131, "prompt_tokens": 287, "total_tokens": 418, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
