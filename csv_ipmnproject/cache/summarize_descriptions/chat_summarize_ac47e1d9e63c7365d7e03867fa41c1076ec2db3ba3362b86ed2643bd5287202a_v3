These thresholds are established by the Board of the institution to effectively manage the level of risk that the institution is willing to accept in its operations. By setting these defined limits, organizations can ensure that their risk exposure remains within acceptable levels, thereby integrating these thresholds into their overall risk management framework. This structured approach helps maintain a balance between risk and operational objectives, ensuring compliance with regulatory standards while safeguarding the institution's financial health.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 126, "prompt_tokens": 335, "total_tokens": 461, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
