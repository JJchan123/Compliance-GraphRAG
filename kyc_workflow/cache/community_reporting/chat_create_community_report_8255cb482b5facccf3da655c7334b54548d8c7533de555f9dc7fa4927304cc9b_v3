Non-face-to-face customers pose higher risks in customer due diligence due to the absence of physical identity verification, necessitating enhanced risk mitigation measures. The community includes various control and enforcement mechanisms such as certification of identity documents, online questionnaires, third party introductions, refusal of business relationships, first payment verification, frequent information updates, independent customer contact, and ongoing monitoring standards. These entities are interrelated as part of a comprehensive framework to manage and mitigate risks associated with non-face-to-face customer relationships, ensuring compliance with AML/CFT policies and effective risk management within the banking sector.\",\n  \"findings\": [\n    {\n      \"summary\": \"Non-Face-to-Face Customers represent a high-risk category requiring enhanced due diligence\",\n      \"explanation\": \"Non-face-to-face customers are identified as a higher risk type in customer due diligence processes because the customer is not physically present for identity verification. This absence of face-to-face interaction increases the risk of identity fraud and money laundering. Therefore, AIs must apply enhanced measures to mitigate these risks effectively. This categorization drives the implementation of multiple specific controls and monitoring standards tailored to address the unique challenges posed by non-face-to-face relationships [Data: Entities (245)].\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"summary\": \"Certification of identity documents is a critical control measure for non-face-to-face customers\",\n      \"explanation\": \"Certification of identity documents is directly linked to non-face-to-face customers as a specific risk mitigation measure. This process ensures the authenticity of identity verification despite the lack of physical presence, thereby reducing the risk of fraudulent identities being accepted. It forms a foundational element of the enhanced due diligence framework applied to these customers, reinforcing the integrity of customer identification processes [Data: Relationships (392)].\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"summary\": \"Online questionnaires serve as a tool for collecting independently verifiable customer information\",\n      \"explanation\": \"Online questionnaires are employed to gather a wide range of information from non-face-to-face customers. The design of these questionnaires enables the collection of data that can be independently verified, enhancing the effectiveness of customer identification and risk assessment. This measure supports the broader objective of mitigating risks associated with remote account openings and maintaining compliance with regulatory standards [Data: Entities (247); Relationships (393)].\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"summary\": \"Third party introduction acts as an intermediary control to mitigate risks\",\n      \"explanation\": \"The use of third party introductions involves intermediaries that meet specific due diligence criteria to introduce customers to the AI. This control measure helps mitigate risks by leveraging trusted third parties to verify customer identities and legitimacy, thereby reducing the exposure of AIs to fraudulent or high-risk customers in non-face-to-face scenarios. It is an important component of the layered risk management approach [Data: Entities (248); Relationships (394)].\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"summary\": \"Refusal of business relationship is an enforcement measure for high-risk non-face-to-face customers\",\n      \"explanation\": \"When adequate face-to-face contact or equivalent verification cannot be achieved, AIs have the authority to refuse establishing a business relationship with non-face-to-face customers deemed higher risk. This enforcement measure serves as a critical safeguard to prevent onboarding customers whose identities or intentions cannot be satisfactorily verified, thereby protecting the institution from potential compliance breaches and financial crime risks [Data: Entities (250); Relationships (396)].\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"summary\": \"First payment verification confirms legitimacy of customer accounts\",\n      \"explanation\": \"First payment verification requires that the initial payment from a non-face-to-face customer’s account be made through an account in the customer’s name at another Authorized Institution or foreign bank with comparable due diligence standards. This control helps verify the legitimacy of the customer's account and reduces the risk of money laundering or fraudulent transactions at the outset of the business relationship [Data: Entities (252); Relationships (397)].\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"summary\": \"Frequent information updates ensure current and accurate customer data\",\n      \"explanation\": \"Frequent information updates are applied to non-face-to-face customers to maintain up-to-date and accurate customer information. This ongoing data refresh supports timely detection of changes in the customer's risk profile and enhances the institution's ability to respond to emerging risks effectively. It is a proactive risk mitigation measure integral to dynamic customer due diligence [Data: Entities (253); Relationships (398)].\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"summary\": \"Independent customer contact verifies identity and legitimacy\",\n      \"explanation\": \"Independent customer contact involves the AI making direct contact with the customer independently to verify identity and gather information. This measure is particularly important for non-face-to-face customers, providing an additional layer of verification beyond documentation and third party introductions. It strengthens the institution's confidence in the customer's legitimacy and supports compliance with AML/CFT requirements [Data: Entities (257); Relationships (400)].\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"summary\": \"Ongoing monitoring standards apply continuous risk assessment to non-face-to-face customers\",\n      \"explanation\": \"Ongoing monitoring standards require continuous application of procedures to monitor customer transactions and activities, aiming to detect suspicious behavior. These standards are applied equally to face-to-face and non-face-to-face customers, ensuring that non-face-to-face relationships are subject to consistent and rigorous oversight throughout the business relationship lifecycle.
