Key entities include the Board, Board-level Committees such as the Audit Committee, the Internal Audit Function, and documented Compliance Policies. The Board delegates oversight responsibilities to independent committees that review and approve compliance policies and monitor their implementation. The Internal Audit Function plays a critical role in evaluating risk management systems, identifying deficiencies, assessing risk measurement techniques, and reporting non-compliance. Coordination between the Audit Committee and the Risk Committee ensures comprehensive risk governance. These relationships collectively support robust compliance with regulatory standards and effective supervisory frameworks.\",\n  \"findings\": [\n    {\n      \"summary\": \"Board-level Committees provide independent oversight of compliance policies\",\n      \"explanation\": \"The Board designates committees, such as the Audit Committee, with independence and a clear mandate to review and approve the compliance policy and to conduct regular reviews of its implementation. This delegation ensures that compliance oversight is conducted with sufficient autonomy and rigor, enhancing the effectiveness of compliance governance within the institution. The Board-level Committee's role is pivotal in maintaining the integrity of compliance frameworks and ensuring adherence to regulatory requirements [Data: Entities (490, 77, 489); Relationships (1075, 1073)].\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"summary\": \"Internal Audit Function is central to evaluating risk management and compliance effectiveness\",\n      \"explanation\": \"The Internal Audit Function operates independently within the AI to assess the adequacy and effectiveness of internal controls and risk management systems. It regularly reviews critical processes such as the product approval process to ensure compliance and operational effectiveness. Furthermore, it identifies and reports material risk management deficiencies and non-compliance issues to the Board or Audit Committee, facilitating timely rectification and risk mitigation. Its performance and independence are assessed by the HKMA to determine the extent of reliance during supervisory examinations, underscoring its importance in the supervisory framework [Data: Entities (60); Relationships (694, 1273, 1269, 1272)].\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"summary\": \"Risk management deficiencies require prompt identification and rectification\",\n      \"explanation\": \"Material weaknesses or shortcomings in an AI's risk management framework, internal controls, or compliance processes are classified as risk management deficiencies.
