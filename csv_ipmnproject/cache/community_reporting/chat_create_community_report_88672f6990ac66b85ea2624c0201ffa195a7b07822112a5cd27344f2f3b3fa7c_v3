This approach emphasizes the assessment and management of risks within the banking sector, allowing Authorized Institutions (AIs) to allocate resources effectively towards areas of greatest concern. By aligning compliance efforts with the actual level of risk, the Risk-Based Approach enhances overall financial compliance and optimizes resource allocation.
