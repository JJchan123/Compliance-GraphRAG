The HKMA emphasizes that these systems are essential for maintaining stability in the banking sector and for the effective supervision of AIs. As part of its supervisory framework, the HKMA evaluates the adequacy and effectiveness of the risk management systems in place at AIs, ensuring they can identify, assess, and manage risks effectively. The authority oversees the implementation of these systems, providing guidelines and standards that AIs must adopt to facilitate effective risk assessment, monitoring, and management practices. Ultimately, the HKMA requires AIs to implement sound risk management systems to mitigate risks and uphold safety and soundness standards within the financial landscape.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 162, "prompt_tokens": 623, "total_tokens": 785, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
