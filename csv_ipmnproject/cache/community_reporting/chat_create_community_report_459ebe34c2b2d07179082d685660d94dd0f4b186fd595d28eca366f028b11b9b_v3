Key entities include various types of inherent risks such as credit, market, interest rate, liquidity, operational, legal, reputation, and strategic risks, alongside emerging risks like climate risk. These entities are interconnected through risk management systems and reports that facilitate compliance and regulatory adherence.\",\n    \"findings\": [\n        {\n            \"summary\": \"Inherent Risks as Core Components\",\n            \"explanation\": \"The HKMA identifies eight inherent risks that AIs must manage: credit, market, interest rate, liquidity, operational, legal, reputation, and strategic risks. These risks are critical for AIs as they form the foundation of the risk management framework mandated by the HKMA. Each risk category requires specific strategies for assessment and mitigation to ensure compliance with regulatory standards. For instance, liquidity risk can severely impact an AI's ability to meet financial obligations, making it essential for AIs to maintain adequate liquid assets.

These risks are not fully understood and can significantly impact the inherent risks faced by AIs. For example, climate risk may exacerbate credit risk due to business disruptions or increase reputation risk as market sentiments shift towards sustainability. AIs must proactively manage these emerging risks to safeguard their operations and ensure compliance.
