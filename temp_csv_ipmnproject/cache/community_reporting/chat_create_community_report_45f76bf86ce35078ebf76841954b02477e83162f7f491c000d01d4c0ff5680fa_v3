Management Oversight plays a critical leadership role, ensuring accountability and timely addressing of material weaknesses, thereby reinforcing the risk management framework. Internal Audit functions independently to review operations and controls, supported by comprehensive Audit Documentation that records audit activities, findings, and management responses. The relationships among these entities establish a robust compliance environment aligned with regulatory standards, facilitating effective risk identification, mitigation, and supervisory processes.\",\n  \"findings\": [\n    {\n      \"summary\": \"Management Oversight is a fundamental component of the Risk Management System\",\n      \"explanation\": \"Management Oversight provides essential leadership and accountability within the Risk Management System. It ensures that material weaknesses are identified and addressed promptly and effectively. This oversight strengthens the overall risk management framework and enhances organizational resilience by fostering an environment conducive to monitoring, controlling, and mitigating risks in alignment with regulatory and operational standards.
