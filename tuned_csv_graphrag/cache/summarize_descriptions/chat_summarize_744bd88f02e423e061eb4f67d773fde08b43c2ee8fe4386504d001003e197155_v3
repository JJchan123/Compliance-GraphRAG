Senior management typically delegates the responsibility of overseeing risk management frameworks, including Anti-Money Laundering and Countering the Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT) risks, to the CRO. The CRO, in turn, works closely with senior management to monitor and address any exceptions or breaches in risk limit utilization, ensuring that risk exposures remain within approved thresholds. In exceptional circumstances where appointing a dedicated CRO is not justified, a senior manager may assume the CRO’s responsibilities, provided that these roles are compatible and internal controls remain effective. This arrangement underscores the importance of clear role delineation and strong internal controls to maintain robust governance and risk oversight within the organization.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 158, "prompt_tokens": 326, "total_tokens": 484, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
