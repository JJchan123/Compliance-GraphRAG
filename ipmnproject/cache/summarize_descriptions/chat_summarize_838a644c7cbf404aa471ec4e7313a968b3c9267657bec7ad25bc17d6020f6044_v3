It encompasses the identification, assessment, and prioritization of risks, followed by coordinated efforts aimed at minimizing, monitoring, and controlling the probability or impact of unfortunate events. This process is crucial for organizations, particularly when introducing new products or services, as it ensures that potential issues are addressed prior to launch.\n\nIn the context of artificial intelligence (AI), risk management practices are essential. These practices include the implementation of processes and procedures designed to identify, measure, monitor, and control risks associated with AI activities. The goal is to evaluate and mitigate risks that may arise from the dynamic and evolving environment in which AI operates. By establishing robust risk management systems, organizations can effectively navigate the complexities and uncertainties inherent in AI development and deployment.\n\nOverall, risk management serves as a vital framework for organizations to safeguard their interests, enhance decision-making, and promote sustainable growth by proactively addressing potential risks.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 197, "prompt_tokens": 291, "total_tokens": 488, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
