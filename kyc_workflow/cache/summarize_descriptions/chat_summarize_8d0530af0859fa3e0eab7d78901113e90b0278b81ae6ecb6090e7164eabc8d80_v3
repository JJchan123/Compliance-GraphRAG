This incorporation aims to enhance the prevention of money laundering and terrorist financing within Hong Kong’s financial sector. The HKMA mandates that all authorized institutions under its supervision implement robust customer due diligence policies as a critical component of their AML/CFT countermeasures. These policies require financial institutions to verify the identity of their customers, assess risks associated with customer relationships, and monitor transactions to detect and prevent illicit activities. By enforcing these CDD requirements, the HKMA ensures effective governance and risk management practices are maintained across the banking industry, aligning local regulatory frameworks with international standards to safeguard the integrity of the financial system.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 164, "prompt_tokens": 297, "total_tokens": 461, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
