This examination forms a critical component of the HKMA’s supervisory methodology, particularly for AIs identified as having higher risks related to money laundering and terrorist financing (ML/TF), where such reviews are conducted more frequently and encompass thorough assessments of Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT) systems across all operational areas. The findings from the risk-focused examination directly inform the assignment of a risk management rating, which is a key element incorporated into the broader CAMEL rating framework used by the HKMA to assess the overall safety and soundness of Authorized Institutions. This supervisory activity ensures effective governance and risk management by identifying weaknesses and promoting the strengthening of risk controls within financial organizations under HKMA oversight.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 207, "prompt_tokens": 541, "total_tokens": 748, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
