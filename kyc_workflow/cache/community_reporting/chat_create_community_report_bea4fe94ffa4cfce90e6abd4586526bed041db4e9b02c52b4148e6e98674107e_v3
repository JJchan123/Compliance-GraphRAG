Key entities include corporate customers with complex multi-layer ownership structures, principal shareholders, beneficial owners, professional third parties, state-owned enterprises, non-listed companies, and financial institutions regulated by HKMA, SFC, or other authorized bodies. The relationships highlight the critical roles of AIs in conducting customer due diligence, verifying ownership structures, and relying on professional third parties for documentation in jurisdictions lacking direct company search capabilities. These interactions form a network essential for effective governance, risk management, and compliance with AML/CFT policies within the banking sector.\",\n  \"findings\": [\n    {\n      \"summary\": \"Authorized Institutions' central role in AML/CFT compliance and ownership verification\",\n      \"explanation\": \"Authorized Institutions serve as the primary entities responsible for implementing AML/CFT compliance frameworks under HKMA supervision.

This verification is essential to mitigate risks associated with money laundering and terrorist financing, ensuring transparency and effective governance.

Authorized Institutions must trace these ownership chains to identify the ultimate beneficial owners, focusing verification efforts on natural persons at the top of the ownership hierarchy. Non-listed companies frequently exhibit such complex structures, requiring detailed scrutiny to prevent misuse for money laundering or terrorist financing.
