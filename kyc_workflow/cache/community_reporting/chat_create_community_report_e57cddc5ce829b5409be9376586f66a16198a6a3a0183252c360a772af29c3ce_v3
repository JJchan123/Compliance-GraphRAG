The key entities include AIs, their internal governance structures such as boards and risk committees, risk management functions, and external stakeholders like auditors, law enforcement agencies, and third-party service providers. AIs implement comprehensive AML/CFT systems encompassing customer due diligence (CDD), enhanced due diligence for high-risk customers, transaction monitoring, and oversight of correspondent banking and overseas operations. Communication flows and compliance roles are structured to ensure proper documentation, verification of customer identities including beneficial owners and account signatories, and adherence to regulatory requirements such as FATF Recommendations.

AIs also manage correspondent banking relationships, wire transfers, and transactions involving professional intermediaries, ensuring robust monitoring and reporting of suspicious activities. Their governance frameworks incorporate internal controls, compliance audits, and risk management systems to maintain adherence to legal and regulatory obligations, thereby safeguarding the financial system against illicit activities [Data: Entities (13, 64); Relationships (90, 249, 777, 23, 26, 40, 169, 190, 207, 232, 260, 266, 427, 678, 704, 710, 724, 725, 749, 756, 769)].\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"summary\": \"Risk-based customer due diligence and enhanced scrutiny for high-risk customers\",\n      \"explanation\": \"AIs adopt a risk-based approach to customer due diligence, tailoring verification and monitoring efforts according to assessed risk levels.

This approach ensures that AIs allocate resources effectively to mitigate money laundering and terrorist financing risks.
