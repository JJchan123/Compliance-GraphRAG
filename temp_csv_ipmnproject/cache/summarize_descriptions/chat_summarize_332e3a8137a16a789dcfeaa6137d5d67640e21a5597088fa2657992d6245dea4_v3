These policies enable proactive, firm-wide risk management by establishing objective risk identification methods, consistent measurement approaches, rigorous risk assessment and reporting, sound valuation and stress-testing techniques, as well as effective monitoring and control mechanisms. They encompass all material financial and non-financial risks on both a firm-wide and group-wide basis. To ensure their continued relevance and effectiveness in a dynamic environment, these policies and procedures must be regularly reviewed and updated by the Board or its designated committees, who are also responsible for their approval. This governance framework ensures robust risk mitigation aligned with regulatory standards and organizational objectives.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 158, "prompt_tokens": 359, "total_tokens": 517, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
