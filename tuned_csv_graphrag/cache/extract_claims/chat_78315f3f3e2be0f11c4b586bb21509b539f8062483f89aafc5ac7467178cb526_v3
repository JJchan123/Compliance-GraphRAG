In exceptional cases where, for example, an AI’s size and complexity do not justify specifically appointing a person for such responsibility, one of the senior managers (such as the person in charge of internal control) may share this responsibility, provided that the roles are compatible and do not weaken checks and balances within the AI. 5.1.5 The Chief Risk Officer should have skills and experience which are relevant and appropriate to the nature and complexity of an AI’s business activities. Moreover, he should have sufficient independence, authority and stature to enable him to challenge any proposal or decision from the risk management perspective. In this regard, the Chief Risk Officer should have unfettered access to any information necessary to perform his duties. The Chief Risk Officer should have duties distinct from other executive functions, and should not have management or financial responsibility related to any business lines or revenue-generating functions. 5.1.6 The Chief Risk Officer should have a direct reporting line to the AI’s Chief Executive and should also report directly (without the presence of executive directors and the senior management where appropriate) to the Board or its Risk Committee regularly and when necessary on risk management issues. In particular, he should play a key role in enabling the Board, Risk Committee and senior management to understand the AI’s evolving risk profile against the approved risk appetite, and should report to the Board and the Risk Committee promptly on any material breach of risk limits and any adverse development that may result in the AI’s risk appetite being exceeded. The performance and remuneration of the Chief Risk Officer should be reviewed and approved by the Board (or its designated committee). 5.1.7 As part of his responsibilities for the AI’s risk management function, among other things, the Chief Risk Officer should ensure that prompt action is taken when any material risk exposure is close to, or exceeds, the AI’s approved risk appetite and relevant risk limits.
