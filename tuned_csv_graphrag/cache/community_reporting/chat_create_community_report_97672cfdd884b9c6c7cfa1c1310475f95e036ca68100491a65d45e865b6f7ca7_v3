Central to the ecosystem is the Board of Directors, empowered by risk governance arrangements to oversee risk appetite, risk limits, and risk management policies. The Board delegates responsibilities to specialized Board-level committees such as the Asset and Liability Management Committee and promotes independent risk management and control functions staffed by competent personnel. The Board also ensures alignment of capital and financial plans with the institution's risk appetite, oversees stress-testing objectives and scenarios, and enforces compliance with HKMA guidelines including CG-1 and CG-5. Communication mechanisms and independence of risk management staff are emphasized to maintain effective governance and risk oversight.

The Board is responsible for reviewing and approving the Risk Appetite Statement, which articulates the institution's risk-taking motivations and limits, thereby guiding strategic and operational decision-making. It also oversees capital and financial plans to ensure alignment with the institution's risk profile and appetite. The Board's responsibilities extend to considering changes in the external environment when assessing risk appetite and making strategic decisions.

This includes ensuring the competence of managers and staff responsible for risk management through appropriate recruitment, training, and retention programs. The independence of risk management staff is critical to provide unbiased oversight and maintain robust control mechanisms, which the Board monitors actively.
