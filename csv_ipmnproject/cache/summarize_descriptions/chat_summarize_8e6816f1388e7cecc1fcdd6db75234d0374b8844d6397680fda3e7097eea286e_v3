This risk is characterized by the potential loss in value stemming from negative public opinion or perception, often arising from compliance failures. It is a critical aspect of risk management for AIs and is explicitly included in their risk appetite statements. \n\nReputation risk is recognized as one of the eight inherent risks assessed by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA), highlighting its importance in the regulatory landscape. AIs must actively manage this risk, as it can lead to a decline in customer base, costly litigation, or revenue reductions, influenced by market rumors or public perceptions. Furthermore, this risk is a material area that should be addressed in risk management reports and must be considered when launching new products or services. Overall, reputation risk is a significant consideration in the risk management policies of Authorized Institutions, underscoring the necessity for effective strategies to mitigate its impact.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 204, "prompt_tokens": 543, "total_tokens": 747, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
