Central to this ecosystem are the AIs themselves, which implement critical compliance functions such as Relationship Management and Periodic Review. Relationship Management oversees private banking customer relationships ensuring adherence to Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT) requirements, while Periodic Review is a formal supervisory process conducted at least annually to reassess politically exposed persons (PEPs) and intermediaries for ongoing compliance. Supporting these functions is an effective Monitoring System designed to detect unusual or suspicious transactions promptly. This system underpins Ongoing Monitoring activities, which involve continuous review and updating of customer information and transactions to identify suspicious activities. The interrelations among these entities form a robust compliance and risk management framework aimed at maintaining governance standards and mitigating financial crime risks within the banking sector.\",\n  \"findings\": [\n    {\n      \"summary\": \"Authorized Institutions conduct Periodic Reviews to ensure ongoing compliance with due diligence criteria.\",\n      \"explanation\": \"Periodic Review is a formal supervisory process conducted by Authorized Institutions, typically on at least an annual basis, focusing on politically exposed persons (PEPs) and other intermediaries.
