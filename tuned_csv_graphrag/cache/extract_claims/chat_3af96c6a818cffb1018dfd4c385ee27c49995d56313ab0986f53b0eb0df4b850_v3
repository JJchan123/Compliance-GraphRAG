The eight types of inherent risk. version: V.2-23.12.2022. 2. The eight types of inherent risk 2.1 Credit risk 2.2 Market risk 2.3 Interest rate risk 2.4 Liquidity risk 2.5 Operational risk 2.6 Reputation risk 2.7 Legal risk 2.8 Strategic risk 2.9 Emerging risk types 2.1.1 This is the risk that a borrower or counterparty may fail to fulfill an obligation. The assessment of credit risk involves evaluating both the probability of default by the counterparty, obligor or issuer and the exposure or financial impact on the AI in the event of default. 2.2 Market risk 2.2.1 This is the risk to an AI's financial condition resulting from adverse movements in market rates or prices such as foreign exchange rates, commodity or equity prices. The primary determinant of the inherent market risk of a business line is the volatility of the relevant markets. In assessing inherent market risk one must consider, however, the interaction between market volatility and business strategy. A trading strategy that focuses exclusively on intermediation between end-users will tend to result in less market risk than a purely proprietary strategy. 2.3 Interest rate risk 2.3.1 This is the risk to an AI's financial condition resulting from adverse movements in interest rates. In determining the levels of interest rate risk, assessments are made of the levels of repricing risk, basis risk, options risk and yield curve risk. In addition, evaluations are made of the funding strategy with respect to interest rate movements and the impact of the overall business strategy on interest rate risk. 2.4 Liquidity risk 2.4.1 This is the risk that an AI may be unable to meet its obligations as they fall due. This may be caused by \"funding liquidity risk\", i.e. the AI's inability to liquidate assets or to obtain funding to meet its obligations. The problem could also be caused by \"market liquidity risk\", where the AI cannot easily unwind)\n<|COMPLETE|>", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 552, "prompt_tokens": 1576, "total_tokens": 2128, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 1024, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
