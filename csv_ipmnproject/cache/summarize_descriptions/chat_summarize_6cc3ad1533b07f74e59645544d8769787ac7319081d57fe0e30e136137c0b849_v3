This risk is one of the eight inherent risks that AIs must manage within their risk frameworks, necessitating careful assessment and management to ensure compliance with regulatory standards. AIs are required to establish risk limits and incorporate interest rate risk considerations when introducing new products or services. The assessment of this risk includes various components such as repricing risk, basis risk, options risk, and yield curve risk, all of which are essential for maintaining the financial stability of AIs. Overall, effective management of interest rate risk is crucial for safeguarding the financial condition of AIs in a fluctuating interest rate environment.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 161, "prompt_tokens": 557, "total_tokens": 718, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
