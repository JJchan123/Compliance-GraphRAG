The Internal Audit Function operates independently to assess and verify the effectiveness of the Authorized Institutions’ AML policies and the overall compliance function. This includes conducting thorough evaluations and control checks not only within domestic operations but also extending to overseas units, ensuring that AML/CFT controls are consistently applied and effective across all jurisdictions in which the Authorized Institutions operate. Through this independent oversight, the Internal Audit Function supports Authorized Institutions in maintaining robust risk management practices and regulatory compliance, thereby enhancing the integrity and resilience of their financial operations.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 138, "prompt_tokens": 291, "total_tokens": 429, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
