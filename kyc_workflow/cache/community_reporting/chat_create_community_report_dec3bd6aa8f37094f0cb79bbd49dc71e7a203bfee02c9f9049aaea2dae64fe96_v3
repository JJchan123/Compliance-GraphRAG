These overseas entities are mandated to apply higher AML/CFT standards where local laws permit and must inform the HKMA if they are unable to meet group standards. The local laws in the jurisdictions where these branches operate can influence the application of these AML/CFT standards, potentially limiting or modifying compliance obligations. The relationship between overseas branches and local laws is critical in understanding the compliance framework and supervisory challenges faced by AIs in maintaining robust risk management and regulatory adherence across borders.\",\n  \"findings\": [\n    {\n      \"summary\": \"Overseas branches or subsidiaries of Hong Kong incorporated AIs are subject to enhanced AML/CFT requirements.\",\n      \"explanation\": \"The overseas branches or subsidiaries of Hong Kong incorporated authorized institutions must comply with the AML/CFT requirements outlined in the Supplement to the Guideline on Prevention of Money Laundering. These requirements mandate the application of higher standards than local norms where local laws permit, ensuring that the group’s risk management and compliance frameworks are consistently upheld across jurisdictions. This approach reflects the HKMA’s emphasis on maintaining robust financial crime prevention measures throughout the entire banking group, not just within Hong Kong operations. Such a policy supports effective governance and risk mitigation across the international footprint of AIs, reinforcing the integrity of the financial system.

This dynamic introduces complexity in risk management and compliance oversight, requiring careful communication and coordination between overseas branches, local regulators, and the HKMA.
