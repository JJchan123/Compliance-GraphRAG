This examination specifically focuses on the AI’s ability to manage inherent risks and ensure compliance with established risk policies and limits. The scope of these on-site examinations may be adjusted or reduced if the AI’s internal audit function is assessed by the HKMA as acceptable and reliable, reflecting a risk-based approach to supervisory oversight.
