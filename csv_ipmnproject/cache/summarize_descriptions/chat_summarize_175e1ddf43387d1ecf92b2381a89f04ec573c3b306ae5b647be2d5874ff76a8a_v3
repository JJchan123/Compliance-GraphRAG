This compliance is vital to ensure that AIs do not engage in transactions with sanctioned entities or individuals, thereby upholding the integrity of the financial system. Furthermore, adherence to sanctions imposed by the United Nations and other regulatory bodies is essential for AIs to prevent the financing of terrorism and other illicit activities. This comprehensive approach to sanctions compliance not only safeguards the institutions themselves but also contributes to broader efforts in maintaining global security and regulatory standards.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 117, "prompt_tokens": 281, "total_tokens": 398, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
