Key entities include the AIs themselves, their customers who are the subjects of AML/CFT policies, and a set of regulatory documents such as the Supplement to the Guideline on Prevention of Money Laundering, which integrates international standards from the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and the Financial Action Task Force (FATF). The Supplement also reflects local anti-terrorism legislation and is supported by interpretative notes to clarify implementation. A critical operational component is the review process mandating periodic reassessment of customer risk profiles. The relationships among these entities form a comprehensive ecosystem ensuring that AIs maintain robust risk management and compliance systems aligned with both international and local regulatory expectations.\",\n  \"findings\": [\n    {\n      \"summary\": \"Authorized Institutions are central to AML/CFT implementation\",\n      \"explanation\": \"Authorized Institutions (AIs) serve as the primary entities responsible for executing AML/CFT policies and procedures within the Hong Kong banking sector.
