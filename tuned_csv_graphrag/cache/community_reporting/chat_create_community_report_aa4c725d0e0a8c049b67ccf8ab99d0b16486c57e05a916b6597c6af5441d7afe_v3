The HKMA acts as the Relevant Authority under the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Financing of Terrorism Ordinance (AMLO), overseeing AIs' compliance with prudential standards, risk management frameworks, and AML/CFT systems. Key entities include the AIs themselves, the HKMA supervisory teams, internal governance bodies such as Boards of Directors and senior management, internal audit and risk management functions, external auditors, and legislative frameworks including the Banking Ordinance and AML/CFT-related ordinances. The HKMA conducts risk-based supervision through periodic risk profiling, risk-focused on-site examinations, thematic examinations targeting high-risk areas like private banking and trade finance, and post-on-site visitations. Communication flows occur between AIs and the HKMA via status reports, supervisory meetings, and AML/CFT seminars. Compliance roles are distributed across internal functions within AIs and external stakeholders, ensuring robust governance, risk controls, and adherence to sanctions and international standards.

It enforces prudential standards, risk management requirements, and AML/CFT compliance through a comprehensive supervisory framework. The HKMA conducts risk-based supervision including periodic risk profiling, on-site examinations, thematic reviews, and post-examination follow-ups. It also organizes AML/CFT seminars and issues circulars and guidance papers to clarify regulatory expectations. The HKMA engages with external auditors and internal governance structures within AIs to ensure effective oversight and compliance. This central role positions the HKMA as the key authority maintaining the stability and integrity of Hong Kong's banking system [Data: Entities (93, 204, 1), Relationships (165, 348, 450, 488, 163, 802)].\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"summary\": \"Authorized Institutions’ governance and risk management frameworks\",\n      \"explanation\": \"Authorized Institutions are required to maintain robust governance structures involving Boards of Directors, senior management, and internal risk management functions. The Board approves risk management policies aligned with the institution's risk appetite and business strategy. AIs implement comprehensive risk management systems covering eight inherent risk types including credit, market, operational, liquidity, legal, reputation, and strategic risks. They also maintain contingency, business continuity, and recovery planning to ensure operational resilience. Risk management information systems support monitoring and reporting. These frameworks enable AIs to identify, measure, and control risks effectively, facilitating compliance with prudential and AML/CFT requirements [Data: Entities (1, 405, 524), Relationships (863, 1169)].\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"summary\": \"AML/CFT systems as integral components of compliance and risk mitigation\",\n      \"explanation\": \"AML/CFT systems within Authorized Institutions comprise risk-based policies, procedures, controls, and monitoring mechanisms designed to prevent, detect, and report money laundering and terrorist financing activities. Key components include customer due diligence, enhanced due diligence for higher-risk customers, suspicious transaction monitoring, record keeping, and staff training. These systems operate under HKMA supervision and are supported by relevant legislation such as the Organized and Serious Crimes Ordinance, Drug Trafficking (Recovery of Proceeds) Ordinance, and United Nations (Anti-Terrorism Measures) Ordinance. The HKMA conducts thematic examinations focusing on high-risk areas like private banking, trade finance, and sanctions compliance to assess AML/CFT effectiveness.

Periodic risk profiling assesses the ML/TF risk levels of individual AIs by combining inherent risk ratings with impact assessments. This profiling informs supervisory planning, including the scope and intensity of on-site examinations and thematic reviews. The risk profile matrix guides the determination of composite risk profiles for significant activities within AIs.
