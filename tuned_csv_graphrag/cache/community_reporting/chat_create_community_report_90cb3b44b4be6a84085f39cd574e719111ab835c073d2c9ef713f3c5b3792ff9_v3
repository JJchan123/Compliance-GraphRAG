It includes the Risk Measurement, Monitoring and Management Reporting Systems, Internal Controls and Comprehensive Audits, and Policies, Procedures and Limit Structure. The Risk Measurement Systems provide timely and accurate data on financial condition and risk exposures, supporting decision-making and oversight. Internal Controls and Audits serve as mechanisms to detect deficiencies and assure the effectiveness of risk management systems independently. Policies, Procedures, and Limit Structures establish documented guidelines and limits to control risk exposures. The relationships among these entities illustrate a comprehensive risk management framework where policies guide risk measurement systems, internal audits provide independent assurance on these systems, and internal controls and audits collectively assure the overall risk management framework's effectiveness.\",\n  \"findings\": [\n    {\n      \"summary\": \"Central role of Risk Measurement, Monitoring and Management Reporting Systems\",\n      \"explanation\": \"The Risk Measurement, Monitoring and Management Reporting Systems are pivotal in the AI's risk governance framework. They deliver comprehensive, timely, and accurate information on all quantifiable and material risk factors affecting the institution. This enables line managers and senior management to monitor risk exposures continuously and supports effective oversight and decision-making across all business activities. Their critical role is underscored by their high degree of connectivity within the community, reflecting their importance in maintaining sound financial and operational performance [Data: Entities (62)].\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"summary\": \"Internal Audit Function provides independent assurance on risk systems\",\n      \"explanation\": \"The Internal Audit Function is directly linked to the Risk Measurement, Monitoring and Management Reporting Systems by providing independent assurance on their effectiveness. This relationship ensures that the risk measurement and reporting systems operate as intended and that any deficiencies are identified and addressed promptly. This independent oversight is essential for maintaining the integrity and reliability of risk data used in governance and decision-making [Data: Relationships (94)].\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"summary\": \"Internal Controls and Comprehensive Audits underpin the risk management framework\",\n      \"explanation\": \"Internal Controls and Comprehensive Audits serve as established mechanisms within the risk management framework to detect deficiencies in the internal control environment promptly.
