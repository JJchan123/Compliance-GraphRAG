Risk management policies, procedures and limits.\nversion: V.3 - 06.10.2017.\n consistency between risk limits and business strategies, the Board may wish to approve limits as part of the overall annual budget process.\n4.2.3 Risk limits should be suitable for the size and complexity of an AI’s business activities and compatible with the sophistication of its products and services and should not merely seek to meet the minimum regulatory requirements or the general market practices. Excessively high limits may fail to trigger prompt management action while overly restrictive limits that are frequently exceeded may undermine the purpose of the limit structure. Risk limits should not be overly complicated, ambiguous or subjective.\n4.2.4 Risk limits should be set at various levels, e.g. individual business lines or units, the entity or the group as a whole. AIs should have a clearly documented methodology for allocating overall risk limits across business lines and units.\n4.2.5 The Board or its designated committee(s) should ensure that limits are subject to regular review and are reassessed in the light of changes in market conditions or business strategies.\n4.2.6 Risk limits should be clearly communicated to the business units and understood by the relevant staff.\n4.2.7 Limit utilisation should be closely monitored. Any excesses or exceptions should be reported promptly to the Chief Risk Officer and the senior management for necessary action.\n4.3 New products and services\n4.3.1 AIs should have an effective mechanism in place to ensure that all products and services launched are subject to proper assessment and approval procedures before launch. There should be an internally approved and clearly documented “new product approval policy” which addresses not only the development and approval of entirely new products and services but also significant changes in the features or risk profile of existing products and services (see Annex 1 for examples). The approach to determining whether changes to existing products and services are considered to be “significant” should also be documented.\n4.3.2 The new product approval policy of an AI and any revisions to it should be approved by the Board)\n<|COMPLETE|>", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 551, "prompt_tokens": 1573, "total_tokens": 2124, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 1024, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
