This approach mandates that AIs establish sound risk management systems to effectively manage eight inherent risks alongside capital adequacy requirements. The HKMA uses this risk-based framework to continuously and dynamically assess and monitor the risk profiles of AIs, focusing supervisory resources on areas of greatest risk to ensure their safety and soundness. By prioritizing risk identification and management, the HKMA allocates its supervisory efforts efficiently, enabling proactive oversight and robust governance within the financial institutions under its jurisdiction.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 123, "prompt_tokens": 466, "total_tokens": 589, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
