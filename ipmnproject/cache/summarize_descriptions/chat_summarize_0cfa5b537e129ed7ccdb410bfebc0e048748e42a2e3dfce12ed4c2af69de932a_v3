It incorporates the risk profile of artificial intelligences (AIs) into the CAMEL rating system, which is a method used to evaluate the soundness and compliance of financial institutions. This approach ensures that the supervisory process remains responsive to the evolving landscape of financial technologies and the associated risks.\n\nBy integrating AIs into the CAMEL rating system, the supervisory process enhances the ability of the HKMA to assess the financial health and operational risks of institutions under its purview. This methodology not only focuses on traditional financial metrics but also adapts to the complexities introduced by technological advancements, thereby promoting a more comprehensive evaluation of institutions' risk profiles.\n\nThe supervisory process is characterized by its emphasis on continuous supervision, which is essential for maintaining the stability and integrity of the financial system. This ongoing oversight allows the HKMA to identify potential issues early and implement necessary interventions to mitigate risks, ensuring that financial institutions operate within a sound and compliant framework.\n\nIn summary, the supervisory process is a crucial element of the HKMA's strategy to oversee financial institutions effectively, incorporating innovative methodologies to address the challenges posed by modern financial technologies while ensuring adherence to regulatory standards.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 249, "prompt_tokens": 196, "total_tokens": 445, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
