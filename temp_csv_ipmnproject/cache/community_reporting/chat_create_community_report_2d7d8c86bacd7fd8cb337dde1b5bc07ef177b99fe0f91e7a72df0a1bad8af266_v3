Central to the community are Authorized Institutions (AIs) and Registered Institutions (RIs) subject to statutory powers under the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing Ordinance (AMLO). The Monetary Authority (MA) and SFC exercise supervisory and disciplinary powers to address AML/CFT deficiencies identified in these institutions.

These powers include issuing reprimands, ordering remedial actions, and imposing pecuniary penalties. This legal framework is fundamental to maintaining regulatory adherence and mitigating risks associated with money laundering and terrorism financing within the financial sector.
