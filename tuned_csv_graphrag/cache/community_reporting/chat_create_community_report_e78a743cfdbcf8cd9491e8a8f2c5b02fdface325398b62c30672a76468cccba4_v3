Section 59(2) empowers the HKMA to require AIs to commission external auditors’ reports focusing on all or specific aspects of their Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT) systems. The external auditors’ report serves as an independent supervisory measure to assess the adequacy and compliance of these systems. The key entities include the MA (Monetary Authority), Section 59(2) as a legislative tool, and the external auditors’ report as a compliance mechanism. The relationships illustrate a direct regulatory mandate from the MA to AIs via Section 59(2), ensuring robust oversight of AML/CFT frameworks through independent audits.\",\n  \"findings\": [\n    {\n      \"summary\": \"Section 59(2) as a legislative enforcement tool\",\n      \"explanation\": \"Section 59(2) is a critical legislative provision that empowers the Monetary Authority (MA) to require Authorized Institutions to commission external auditors’ reports on their AML/CFT systems.
