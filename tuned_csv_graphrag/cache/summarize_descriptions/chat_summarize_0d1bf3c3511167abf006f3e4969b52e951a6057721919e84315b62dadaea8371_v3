This framework includes clearly defined roles and responsibilities across the Board, Risk Committee, Chief Risk Officer, senior management, and various internal functions, ensuring accountability and proper implementation of the AI’s risk appetite and risk management policies.\n\nThe risk governance framework encompasses the establishment and communication of risk limits to business units, continuous monitoring of risk exposures, and escalation procedures for exceptions or excessive risk-taking. It integrates risk measurement techniques, risk management information systems, and internal control systems to provide timely and accurate risk reporting that supports informed decision-making. The framework also promotes a strong risk culture characterized by risk awareness, open communication, and constructive challenge regarding risk-taking behaviors.\n\nRisk governance arrangements are documented, regularly updated, and communicated across the institution to ensure all relevant staff understand their responsibilities in risk oversight and management. The independence and adequate resourcing of risk management and control functions are emphasized to maintain effective governance. Additionally, risk governance includes oversight of specific risk areas such as Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT) risks and the approval and management of new products and services.\n\nThe effectiveness of risk governance is periodically assessed by internal audit functions, with findings reported to the Board or Audit Committee to ensure continuous improvement. Furthermore, risk governance fosters effective communication and information sharing across different organizational functions to prevent siloed decision-making and promote a holistic approach to risk management within the AI.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 322, "prompt_tokens": 1033, "total_tokens": 1355, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
