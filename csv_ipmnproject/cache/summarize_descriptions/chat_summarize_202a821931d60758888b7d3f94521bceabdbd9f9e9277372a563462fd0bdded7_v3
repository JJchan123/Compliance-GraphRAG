This risk is one of the eight inherent risks identified and assessed by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) during the supervisory process. AIs are required to implement risk limits and manage this exposure in accordance with HKMA guidelines. The assessment of interest rate risk encompasses various components, including repricing risk, basis risk, options risk, and yield curve risk, all of which contribute to the overall financial condition of an AI.
