The key entities include the risk-focused on-site examination process, the CAMEL rating, and the composite CAMEL rating. The risk profile of an AI guides the planning and focus of these examinations. Findings from the risk-focused on-site examinations directly influence the management component of the CAMEL rating and the updating of the composite CAMEL rating, which reflects the AI's overall financial condition, compliance, risk management systems, and operating soundness.
