Key entities include the legislative provision Section 71(4), the enforcement action termed Withdrawal of Consent, and the role of Directors who require prior consent from the MA for their appointment. The MA exercises oversight by withdrawing consent under Section 71(4) if a director or chief executive is deemed no longer fit and proper, thereby ensuring governance standards and compliance within AIs.\",\n  \"findings\": [\n    {\n      \"summary\": \"Section 71(4) as the legislative basis for consent withdrawal\",\n      \"explanation\": \"Section 71(4) provides the statutory authority for the Monetary Authority (MA) to withdraw its prior consent for the appointment of a person as director or chief executive of an Authorized Institution. This provision is critical as it empowers the MA to act when a previously approved individual is subsequently found to be no longer fit and proper. The process involves consideration of written representations from the individual concerned, ensuring procedural fairness. This legislative tool underpins the MA's supervisory framework for maintaining high standards of governance within AIs [Data: Entities (164); Relationships (295)].\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"summary\": \"Withdrawal of Consent as an enforcement measure\",\n      \"explanation\": \"Withdrawal of Consent is the enforcement action executed by the HKMA to revoke its prior approval for an individual's appointment as director or chief executive of an AI. This measure is significant because it directly impacts the composition of the board and senior management, thereby influencing the institution's governance and risk management. The withdrawal is based on the determination that the individual is no longer fit and proper, reflecting the MA's commitment to uphold integrity and competence in leadership positions within the banking sector [Data: Entities (155); Relationships (284, 285)].\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"summary\": \"Role and regulatory requirements for Directors of Authorized Institutions\",\n      \"explanation\": \"Directors serve as members of the board of directors of Authorized Institutions and hold responsibility for governance and oversight. Their appointment is subject to the MA's prior consent, emphasizing the regulatory focus on ensuring that only fit and proper individuals occupy these critical roles. Directors must maintain standards of integrity and competence, and failure to do so can trigger enforcement actions such as withdrawal of consent.

Section 71(4) authorizes the MA to withdraw consent, which is operationalized through the enforcement measure Withdrawal of Consent. This enforcement action directly affects Directors who have been appointed with prior consent but are later deemed unfit.
