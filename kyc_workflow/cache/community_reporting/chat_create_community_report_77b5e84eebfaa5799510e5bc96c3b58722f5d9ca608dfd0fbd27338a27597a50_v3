Key entities include the Customer Risk Profile, which assesses the likelihood of customers posing money laundering risks based on attributes such as nationality, citizenship, and resident status. The Customer Acceptance Policy mandates AIs to determine these risk profiles to identify higher-risk customers effectively. The relationships between these entities illustrate the integration of customer attributes into risk assessment processes, which underpin AML/CFT systems and compliance roles within the banking sector.\",\n  \"findings\": [\n    {\n      \"summary\": \"Customer Risk Profile as a core compliance tool\",\n      \"explanation\": \"The Customer Risk Profile is a fundamental component in the AML/CFT framework of Authorized Institutions. It assesses the likelihood that a customer may pose a higher than average risk of money laundering by analyzing various factors, including nationality, business nature, and connections to higher risk jurisdictions.
