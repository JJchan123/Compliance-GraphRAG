It approves risk definitions, risk management strategies, policies, and frameworks, ensuring their proper implementation and periodic review to adapt to evolving business and market conditions. The Board provides strong direction and engagement in sustaining a disciplined risk appetite, overseeing strategic, business, capital, and financial plans, and approving any changes to the AI’s risk appetite statement. It ensures that risk limits are consistent with the institution’s overall risk appetite and that risk management and control functions maintain competence through appropriate recruitment, training, and retention of skilled personnel.\n\nFurthermore, the Board delegates authority to designated committees, such as the Risk Committee, and is responsible for appointing key risk management personnel, including the Chief Risk Officer, while reviewing their performance and remuneration. It ensures clear assignment of risk management responsibilities, maintains effective checks and balances within the AI, and guarantees adequate resources and independence for risk management and control functions.
