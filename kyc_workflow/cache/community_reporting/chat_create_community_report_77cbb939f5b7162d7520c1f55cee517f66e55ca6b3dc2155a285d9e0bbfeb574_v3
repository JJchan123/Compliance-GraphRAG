AIs are responsible for monitoring suspicious transactions, implementing ongoing monitoring procedures, and reporting suspicious transaction reports to the JFIU and HKMA. The Compliance Officer acts as the pivotal figure ensuring adherence to AML/CFT regulations, overseeing transaction reviews, and coordinating with regulatory bodies. The JFIU and HKMA collaborate closely to analyze reports and enforce regulatory compliance. The community is also informed by international standards such as the FATF guidelines on terrorist financing, which aid in identifying suspicious transactions.\",\n  \"findings\": [\n    {\n      \"summary\": \"Central role of the Compliance Officer in AML/CFT governance\",\n      \"explanation\": \"The Compliance Officer within each Authorized Institution serves as the central reference point for identifying, reviewing, and reporting suspicious transactions, ensuring full compliance with AML/CFT regulatory requirements. This officer actively monitors transaction reports, including exception reports of large or irregular transactions generated by the institution’s management information system, and oversees the review process even when delegated. The Compliance Officer also cooperates fully with the Joint Financial Intelligence Unit during investigations and documents decisions not to report suspicious transactions. This role is critical in the institution’s governance, risk management, and regulatory compliance functions, making the Compliance Officer a key stakeholder in the financial compliance community [Data: Entities (300); Relationships (481)].\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"summary\": \"Authorized Institutions' obligations to monitor and report suspicious transactions\",\n      \"explanation\": \"Authorized Institutions are mandated to monitor and identify suspicious transactions that may be linked to terrorist financing or other illicit activities. They must implement ongoing monitoring procedures, particularly for activities conducted through correspondent accounts, to detect such transactions. Upon identification, AIs are required to report suspicious transaction reports to both the Joint Financial Intelligence Unit and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority as part of their AML/CFT supervisory obligations.
