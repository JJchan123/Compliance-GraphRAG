This approach enables them to tailor the extent and intensity of customer due diligence measures proportionate to the assessed risk of money laundering or other financial crimes. Specifically, Authorized Institutions determine verification requirements, including when waivers may be granted, based on the risk profile of customers. They apply this approach to various activities such as correspondent banking and the management of trust and nominee accounts, adjusting due diligence efforts according to the nature and complexity of these arrangements. Furthermore, the risk-based approach informs the levels of approval and ongoing monitoring required, allowing Authorized Institutions to focus resources on higher-risk customers and transactions. This targeted monitoring enhances their ability to detect and respond to suspicious activities effectively, ensuring compliance with regulatory expectations and strengthening overall risk management.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 166, "prompt_tokens": 486, "total_tokens": 652, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
