This risk is critical for AIs to manage effectively, as it can stem from two primary sources: funding liquidity risk, which involves the inability to liquidate assets or secure funding, and market liquidity risk, which arises when an entity cannot unwind specific exposures without incurring significant price reductions due to insufficient market depth.\n\nLiquidity risk is characterized by an imbalance between an entity's liquid assets and its liabilities, making it one of the eight inherent risks that the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) requires AIs to assess, manage, and report on. This risk must be included in comprehensive risk management reports, underscoring its importance in maintaining financial stability and compliance with regulatory standards.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 163, "prompt_tokens": 556, "total_tokens": 719, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
