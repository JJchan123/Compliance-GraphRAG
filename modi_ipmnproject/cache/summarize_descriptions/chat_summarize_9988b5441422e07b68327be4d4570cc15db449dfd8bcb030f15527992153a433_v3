These limits are crucial for ensuring that the level of risk taken by different business units aligns with the institution's overall risk appetite, particularly under stressed conditions. They represent the maximum level of risk that an organization is willing to accept in its operations, and it is essential that these thresholds are communicated clearly and monitored diligently. Furthermore, risk limits must be enforced and reported in risk management reports to maintain compliance and facilitate effective risk management practices. Overall, risk limits serve as a vital framework for organizations to ensure that their risk-taking activities remain within acceptable levels, thereby safeguarding their financial stability and regulatory compliance.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 146, "prompt_tokens": 406, "total_tokens": 552, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
