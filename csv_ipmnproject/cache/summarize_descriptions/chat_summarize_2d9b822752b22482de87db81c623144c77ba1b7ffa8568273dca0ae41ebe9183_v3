The HKMA emphasizes that these systems are essential for mitigating various inherent risks, including credit risk, and for facilitating effective supervision of AIs. To this end, the HKMA conducts evaluations of the risk management systems implemented by AIs, ensuring they are capable of identifying and managing risks effectively. Furthermore, the HKMA mandates that AIs establish comprehensive risk management frameworks to ensure compliance with regulatory standards and to maintain proper risk monitoring practices. Through these measures, the HKMA aims to uphold the integrity of the financial system and promote a stable economic environment.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 147, "prompt_tokens": 415, "total_tokens": 562, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
