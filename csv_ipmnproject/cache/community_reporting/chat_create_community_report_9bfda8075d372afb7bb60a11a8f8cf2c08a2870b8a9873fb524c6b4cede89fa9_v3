It promotes a balanced methodology that ensures compliance with Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Counter Financing of Terrorism (CFT) regulations while also fostering financial inclusion. By tailoring compliance measures to the specific risks associated with customers and transactions, the RBA helps prevent the exclusion of legitimate customers from financial services. This approach is essential for maintaining a stable financial environment that adheres to regulatory standards.

However, overly stringent AML/CFT measures can inadvertently exclude bona fide customers. The RBA addresses this challenge by allowing financial institutions to implement measures that are proportionate to the identified risks, thereby promoting financial inclusion while maintaining compliance with regulatory requirements. This balance is crucial for the sustainability of the financial sector and its ability to serve diverse customer needs.

By incorporating country risk assessments, financial institutions can tailor their compliance measures to the specific risks associated with each country, ensuring that they remain compliant with AML/CFT regulations while effectively managing their exposure to potential risks.

The RBA allows financial institutions to differentiate between various business risks among customers, ensuring that appropriate measures are applied based on the risk profile of each customer. This differentiation is vital for effective risk management and compliance, as it enables institutions to focus their resources on higher-risk customers while facilitating access for lower-risk individuals and businesses.

The RBA requires financial institutions to assess these risks to ensure compliance with AML/CFT regulations.
