Key entities include the Monetary Authority (MA), legislative sections (Section 117, Section 22(1), Section 24(1), Section 25(1)), enforcement actions, guidance notes on AML/CFT supervisory approaches, cooperation levels of AIs, and distinctions between supervisory enforcement and criminal cases. The MA utilizes these legislative tools to oversee, suspend, or revoke AI authorizations, report to the Financial Secretary, and impose enforcement actions considering AI cooperation.

It exercises powers granted by various legislative provisions to ensure compliance with AML/CFT regulations and overall financial stability. The MA assesses the fitness and propriety of controllers of AIs and undertakes enforcement actions against breaches. Its role includes reporting to the Financial Secretary under Section 117 when inquiries into AIs are warranted in the public or depositor interest.
