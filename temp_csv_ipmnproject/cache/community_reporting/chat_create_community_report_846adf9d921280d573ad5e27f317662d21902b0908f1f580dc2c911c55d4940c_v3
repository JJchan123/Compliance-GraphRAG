These limits are aligned with the AI's strategic, business, capital, and financial plans, ensuring consistency with the institution's risk-taking capacity.

It ensures that risk-taking activities are aligned with the AI's strategic objectives and regulatory requirements by setting quantitative thresholds for acceptable risk exposure. This framework integrates with the AI's strategic, business, capital, and financial plans, providing a cohesive structure for risk management and compliance. Its role is pivotal in balancing risk exposure with the institution's capacity to absorb losses, thereby supporting prudent risk-taking and regulatory adherence [Data: Relationships (419, 970, 971, 972, 973, 974)].\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"summary\": \"Risk Limits as integral components of risk management\",\n      \"explanation\": \"Risk Limits are predefined quantitative thresholds established within the AI's risk management framework to control exposures to various risk types such as credit, market, interest rate, liquidity, and concentration risks. These limits are derived from the Risk Appetite Framework and are monitored by the risk management function to ensure exposures remain within acceptable boundaries. The Chief Risk Officer is responsible for escalation and reporting when limits are approached or breached, ensuring timely risk mitigation and compliance with regulatory standards.
