basis.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AUTHORIZED INSTITUTION<|>AUTHORIZED INSTITUTION<|>Authorized Institutions (AIs) are financial institutions regulated by the HKMA, subject to ongoing supervision and risk assessment, including evaluation of inherent risks and emerging risks such as climate risk.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CREDIT RISK<|>RISK TYPE<|>Credit risk is the potential loss due to borrower default or deterioration in asset quality, one of the eight inherent risks identified by the HKMA.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MARKET RISK<|>RISK TYPE<|>Market risk involves potential losses due to changes in market prices or rates, identified as one of the eight inherent risks by the HKMA.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>INTEREST RATE RISK<|>RISK TYPE<|>Interest rate risk is the risk of loss resulting from changes in interest rates affecting an AI's financial condition, one of the eight inherent risks identified by the HKMA.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LIQUIDITY RISK<|>RISK TYPE<|>Liquidity risk is the risk that an AI

response to industry, economic, or technological changes, influenced by the alignment of an organisation’s strategic goals, business strategies, resources, and quality of implementation, one of the eight inherent risks identified by the HKMA.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EMERGING RISK TYPES<|>RISK TYPE<|>Emerging risk types are new and evolving risks that may impact one or more of the eight inherent risks and should be considered in the risk assessment of authorized institutions.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CLIMATE RISK<|>RISK TYPE<|>Climate risk is an emerging risk type that can affect multiple inherent risks faced by authorized institutions, including increasing credit risk through business disruptions and heightening reputation risk due to changing market and consumer sentiment towards environmentally friendly practices.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HKMA<|>AUTHORIZED INSTITUTION<|>The HKMA supervises Authorized Institutions using a risk-based supervisory approach to ensure their safety
