This significant ownership stake positions principal shareholders as key risk factors in customer due diligence and ownership verification processes. Financial institutions, particularly Authorized Institutions, are required to closely monitor the identities of principal shareholders to ensure transparency and mitigate risks associated with misuse, financial crime, and ownership concealment. This oversight is especially critical when shares are held in bearer form, which can obscure the true ownership and increase vulnerability to illicit activities. Overall, principal shareholders represent the main owners of a company whose identification and monitoring are essential components of effective governance and regulatory compliance within the financial sector.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 140, "prompt_tokens": 316, "total_tokens": 456, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
