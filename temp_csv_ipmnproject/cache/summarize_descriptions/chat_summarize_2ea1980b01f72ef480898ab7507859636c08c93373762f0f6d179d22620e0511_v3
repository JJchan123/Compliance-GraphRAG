These risks require careful consideration within the overall risk assessment framework applied to Authorized Institutions (AIs). Emerging risks can pose potential threats to the stability of the banking system, and the HKMA aims to identify and monitor these risks early, both at the level of individual Authorized Institutions and across the banking sector as a whole. This proactive approach ensures that exposures to emerging risks are integrated into risk assessments to safeguard financial stability and regulatory compliance.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 124, "prompt_tokens": 347, "total_tokens": 471, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
