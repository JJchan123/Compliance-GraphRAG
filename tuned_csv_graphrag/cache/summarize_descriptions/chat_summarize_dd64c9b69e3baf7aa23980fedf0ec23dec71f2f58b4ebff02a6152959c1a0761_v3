This process systematically assesses the type, level, and direction of all material risks associated with each significant business activity of the AI. It involves evaluating the level of inherent risk—covering eight key risk categories—alongside the adequacy and effectiveness of the AI’s risk management systems. Additionally, the process considers external risk factors and incorporates judgemental assessments to balance inherent risks against risk controls. The outcome is a composite risk profile for each business activity and an overall risk profile for the AI, which informs the HKMA’s supervisory response and governance oversight. This comprehensive approach ensures that the HKMA maintains effective oversight of the AI’s risk exposures and promotes sound risk management practices within the institution.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 181, "prompt_tokens": 525, "total_tokens": 706, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
