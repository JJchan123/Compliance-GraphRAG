It establishes comprehensive requirements and issues guidance that financial institutions, regulators, and authorized intermediaries must comply with to effectively detect, prevent, and mitigate risks associated with illicit financial activities. FATF’s framework includes mutual evaluations and standards used to assess jurisdictional risks, ensuring consistent global implementation. Over time, FATF has expanded its scope to specifically address terrorist financing, producing nine Special Recommendations that provide detailed guidance to strengthen global counter-terrorism financing efforts. Notably, in April 2002, FATF issued a pivotal guidance paper featuring case studies and characteristics of suspicious transactions linked to terrorist activities, further enhancing the ability of financial entities to identify and respond to such threats. Through these initiatives, FATF plays a central role in shaping international regulatory frameworks and fostering cooperation among countries to safeguard the integrity of the global financial system.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 194, "prompt_tokens": 429, "total_tokens": 623, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
