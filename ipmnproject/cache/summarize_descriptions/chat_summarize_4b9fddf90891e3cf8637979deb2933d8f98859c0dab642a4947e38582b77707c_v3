AIs utilize artificial intelligence (AI) systems to enhance customer relationship management and assess various risks associated with their operations. The HKMA is responsible for evaluating the risk management systems and business activities of these institutions to ensure they maintain financial stability and comply with relevant regulations.\n\nTo fulfill its supervisory role, the HKMA conducts annual meetings and assessments with AIs, focusing on their adherence to banking regulations and risk management standards. This includes a thorough assessment of the risk profiles of activities conducted by AIs, which is essential for safeguarding the overall financial system. The HKMA's oversight extends to ensuring that AIs comply with anti-money laundering (AML) and counter-financing of terrorism (CFT) laws, thereby reinforcing the integrity of the financial sector.\n\nIn addition to regulatory compliance, the HKMA supervises the risk management practices of AI systems to ensure they align with financial regulations. This comprehensive supervision aims to ensure that AIs not only manage risks effectively but also operate in a safe and sound manner. The HKMA's commitment to overseeing the risk management of AI systems is vital for maintaining the stability and resilience of the financial landscape in Hong Kong. \n\nOverall, the HKMA's multifaceted approach to supervising AIs encompasses risk assessment, regulatory compliance, and the enforcement of standards, all of which are essential for fostering a secure and stable financial environment.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 296, "prompt_tokens": 390, "total_tokens": 686, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
