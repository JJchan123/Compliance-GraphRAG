They operate under a comprehensive regulatory and supervisory framework designed to ensure their safety, soundness, and compliance with applicable laws and regulations. AIs are required to maintain robust and effective risk management systems tailored to the nature, scale, and complexity of their business activities, including lending, trading, treasury, and other major operations. These systems encompass internal controls, internal audit functions, compliance functions, and contingency, business continuity, and recovery planning to ensure operational resilience and regulatory compliance.\n\nGovernance within AIs involves clearly defined responsibilities among the Board of Directors, senior management, and internal risk management functions, with the Board approving risk management frameworks and policies aligned with the institution’s risk appetite and business strategy. AIs must implement risk governance arrangements that include risk limits, new product approval processes, and ongoing monitoring and reporting supported by risk management information systems and staff expertise.\n\nAIs are subject to ongoing, risk-based supervision by the HKMA, which includes periodic risk assessments, on-site examinations, prudential meetings with senior management and boards, and evaluation of inherent and emerging risks such as credit, market, operational, liquidity, and climate risks. Their financial condition, business lines, affiliated entities, and risk profiles are continuously assessed to ensure prudential soundness and effective risk management.\n\nIn addition to prudential regulation, AIs play a critical role in Hong Kong’s Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT) regime. They are required to implement comprehensive AML/CFT systems in compliance with the AML/CFT Guideline and the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Financing of Terrorism Ordinance (AMLO). These systems must effectively monitor, detect, and report suspicious transactions, conduct risk-based customer due diligence, maintain records of business relationships and transactions, and collaborate with law enforcement agencies. AIs are subject to ongoing AML/CFT supervision, including thematic examinations focused on high-risk areas such as private banking, trade finance, and sanctions compliance, and must participate in capacity-building initiatives under the Enhanced Competency Framework on AML/CFT.\n\nFailure to comply with regulatory requirements, including AML/CFT obligations, may result in enforcement actions such as remedial plans, suspension, or revocation of authorization. Overall, Authorized Institutions are integral to maintaining the stability and integrity of Hong Kong’s financial system through rigorous risk management, regulatory compliance, and proactive governance under the oversight of the HKMA.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 506, "prompt_tokens": 3045, "total_tokens": 3551, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
