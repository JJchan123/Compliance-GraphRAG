This narrative is an integral part of the broader risk assessment process, which aims to identify, analyze, and mitigate potential risks linked to the deployment and operation of AI technologies. Each Risk Assessment Narrative is tailored specifically for individual AI systems, ensuring that the unique characteristics and functionalities of each AI are taken into account.\n\nThe primary purpose of the Risk Assessment Narrative is to provide a comprehensive overview of the risk management strategies employed for the AI in question. It assesses the effectiveness of these strategies in mitigating identified risks, thereby contributing to a more informed understanding of the AI's operational safety and reliability. By documenting the risks associated with AI, the narrative serves as a foundational tool for stakeholders to make informed decisions regarding the implementation and governance of AI technologies.\n\nIn summary, the Risk Assessment Narrative is a specialized document that plays a vital role in the risk assessment process for AI, focusing on the specific risks and management strategies relevant to each AI system.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 207, "prompt_tokens": 191, "total_tokens": 398, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
