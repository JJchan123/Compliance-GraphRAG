They play a critical role in formulating detailed risk management policies, procedures, and limits aligned with the Board’s strategic, business, capital, and financial plans, ensuring these are effectively executed across the AI. Senior Management is tasked with establishing and maintaining robust risk appetite frameworks and risk appetite statements, implementing controls to monitor risk exposures, and ensuring adherence to risk limits under normal and stressed conditions.\n\nThey are responsible for compiling, reviewing, and providing timely, accurate, and comprehensive risk reports to the Board and relevant committees, facilitating informed decision-making and oversight. This includes reporting on risk culture, risk exposures, risk management activities, and any material risk issues or mitigating actions. Senior Management supports the Board by fostering a strong risk culture, promoting risk awareness, and ensuring effective communication and challenge related to risk-taking throughout the institution.\n\nIn addition to risk governance, Senior Management oversees the implementation and effectiveness of internal controls, compliance functions, and Anti-Money Laundering/Combating the Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT) systems, ensuring these meet regulatory requirements and adopting risk-based approaches consistent with supervisory expectations. They receive and address regulatory feedback, such as examination reports from the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA), and participate in annual prudential meetings to discuss risk control, business outlook, and prudential concerns.\n\nSenior Management ensures that risk management systems, including risk data aggregation and risk reporting frameworks, operate as intended, maintaining the accuracy and appropriateness of data inputs, including those used for remuneration calculations. They actively participate in risk sensitivity analyses, stress testing, and the evaluation and approval of new products or services, ensuring that associated risks are fully understood and managed with adequate resources and expertise.\n\nWhere applicable, Senior Management may share or delegate responsibilities with a Chief Risk Officer (CRO) or other senior managers, ensuring that roles are compatible and internal checks and balances remain effective. They also ensure that staff responsible for risk management and control functions are competent and supported through appropriate recruitment, training, and retention initiatives.\n\nOverall, Senior Management acts as the key operational link between the Board and the institution’s risk management functions, executing the Board’s risk management directives, maintaining effective risk controls and monitoring systems, and ensuring the AI’s safety, soundness, and regulatory compliance.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 494, "prompt_tokens": 1825, "total_tokens": 2319, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
