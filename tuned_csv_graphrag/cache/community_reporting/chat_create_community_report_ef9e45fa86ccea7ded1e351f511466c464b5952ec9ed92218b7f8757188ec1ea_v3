The UNSCRs serve as the foundational regulatory framework mandating financial sanctions to mitigate risks related to money laundering, terrorist financing, and proliferation financing. Financial sanctions are specific enforcement measures derived from these UNSCRs, restricting or prohibiting certain financial transactions. The relationships indicate a structured compliance ecosystem where the HKMA ensures that AIs adhere to these international mandates, integrating global regulatory obligations into local supervisory practices.\",\n  \"findings\": [\n    {\n      \"summary\": \"HKMA's central supervisory role in enforcing UNSCR compliance\",\n      \"explanation\": \"The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) acts as the primary regulatory body ensuring that Authorized Institutions comply with United Nations Security Council Resolutions (UNSCRs). This enforcement role is critical in translating international mandates into actionable supervisory requirements within Hong Kong's banking sector. By overseeing adherence to UNSCRs, the HKMA helps maintain the integrity of the financial system against risks such as money laundering, terrorist financing, and proliferation financing.
