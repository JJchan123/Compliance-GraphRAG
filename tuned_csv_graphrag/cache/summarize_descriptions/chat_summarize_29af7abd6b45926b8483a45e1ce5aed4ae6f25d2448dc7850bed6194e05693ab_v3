Through risk-focused on-site examinations and prudential meetings, the HKMA rigorously assesses both the adequacy and effectiveness of these institutions' risk management frameworks. This evaluation process is designed to ensure that AIs maintain robust systems capable of effectively identifying, measuring, monitoring, and controlling inherent risks associated with their operations.
