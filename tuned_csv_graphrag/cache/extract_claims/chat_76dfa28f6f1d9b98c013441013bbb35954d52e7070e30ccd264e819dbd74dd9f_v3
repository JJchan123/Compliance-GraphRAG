Strong direction from, and the engagement of, the Board is critical to sustaining a disciplined risk appetite for the AI. When faced with, and making decisions in response to, new business opportunities (e.g. possible business expansion or mergers and acquisitions), market demand for increased risk-taking or the need to react promptly to changes in the external environment (e.g. due to competition or deterioration in economic conditions), the Board should ensure that there is an assessment of the AI’s risk appetite in the decision-making process. In these circumstances, the Board should thoroughly understand the AI’s current risk position relative to its risk appetite, and how that position would be changed if the risk appetite were to be changed. In this regard, stress tests may be used to generate a dynamic view of the AI’s capital, liquidity and risk positions. 3.2.5 Any changes to the AI’s risk appetite statement should be approved by the Board. The justification for change should be adequately documented. 3.3 Firm-wide risk management 3.3.1 The Board and senior management should ensure that effective policies, processes and systems are in place to identify, measure, evaluate, monitor, report and control or mitigate all material risks across business activities, whatever the nature of the exposure arising from those activities (such exposure may be non-contractual, contingent or off-balance sheet in nature).
