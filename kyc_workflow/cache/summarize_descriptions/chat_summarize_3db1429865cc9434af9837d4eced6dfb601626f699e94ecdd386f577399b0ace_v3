This system encompasses key components including customer due diligence (CDD), identity verification, risk assessments, enhanced and ongoing monitoring of customer accounts and transactions, and the reporting of suspicious activities. It also involves maintaining detailed records, such as wire transfer information, to ensure transparency and traceability in financial operations. The AML/CFT system operates under regulatory guidelines, such as those issued by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA), and employs a risk-based approach to assess and manage correspondent banking relationships and other financial interactions. Overall, the AML/CFT system is critical for effective governance and compliance within financial institutions, enabling them to mitigate financial crime risks and fulfill their legal and regulatory obligations.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 176, "prompt_tokens": 821, "total_tokens": 997, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
