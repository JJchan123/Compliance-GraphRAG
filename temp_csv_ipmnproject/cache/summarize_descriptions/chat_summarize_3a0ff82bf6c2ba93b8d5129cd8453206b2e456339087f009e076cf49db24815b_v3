The Monetary Authority (MA) reports to the Financial Secretary when it is deemed in the interest of depositors or the public to conduct an inquiry into the affairs of an Authorized Institution (AI). Additionally, the Financial Secretary is consulted by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) before it exercises certain supervisory powers over Authorized Institutions, including actions such as revoking or suspending their authorizations. Beyond banking supervision, the Financial Secretary also chairs the Central Coordinating Committee on Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT), playing a central role in overseeing the formulation and coordination of Hong Kong’s AML/CFT policy. This positions the Financial Secretary as a pivotal figure in ensuring both the stability of the financial sector and the integrity of Hong Kong’s regulatory framework against financial crimes.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 185, "prompt_tokens": 322, "total_tokens": 507, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
