The key entities include the Management Information System (MIS), Risk Monitoring, and Risk Control functions. The MIS serves as the foundational data and communication infrastructure, tailored to the AI's complexity, enabling effective risk measurement and decision-making. Risk Monitoring is an ongoing process that tracks risk exposures and ensures compliance with policies and limits, supported by the MIS through timely and accurate information. Risk Monitoring then informs Risk Control mechanisms, which are implemented to mitigate and manage risks within approved parameters. The relationships among these entities illustrate a structured flow of information and control that underpins robust governance and risk management practices within financial organizations.\",\n  \"findings\": [\n    {\n      \"summary\": \"Management Information System (MIS) as the backbone of risk governance\",\n      \"explanation\": \"The MIS within an AI is a critical system designed to support the monitoring of risk exposures and ensure compliance with established limits. It is tailored to the complexity and volume of the AI’s business activities and product offerings, providing a vital data and information infrastructure. By delivering timely and accurate information, the MIS enables effective risk measurement, ongoing monitoring, and informed decision-making. This foundational role makes the MIS essential for robust governance and risk management practices within financial organizations [Data: Entities (356)].\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"summary\": \"Risk Monitoring as an ongoing compliance and oversight process\",\n      \"explanation\": \"Risk Monitoring is the continuous process within an AI that tracks risk exposures and ensures adherence to policies, guidelines, and limits.
