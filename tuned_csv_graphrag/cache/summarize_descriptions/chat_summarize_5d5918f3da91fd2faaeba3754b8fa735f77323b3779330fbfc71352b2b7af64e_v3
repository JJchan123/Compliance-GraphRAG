Under section 117, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) reports to the Financial Secretary when it is deemed in the interests of depositors or the public to conduct an inquiry into the affairs, business, or property of an authorized institution. Additionally, the Financial Secretary serves as a key stakeholder in the financial sector, as the HKMA is required to consult with this official before exercising significant enforcement powers, including the revocation or suspension of an AI’s authorization or the imposition of conditions on its business operations. This relationship underscores the Financial Secretary’s integral role in ensuring effective governance, regulatory compliance, and the protection of public and depositor interests within Hong Kong’s financial system.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 165, "prompt_tokens": 326, "total_tokens": 491, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
