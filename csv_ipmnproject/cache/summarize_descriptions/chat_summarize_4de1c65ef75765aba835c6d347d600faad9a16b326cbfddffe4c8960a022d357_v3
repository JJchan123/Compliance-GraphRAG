This risk can lead to a decline in the customer base, costly litigation, and revenue reductions, ultimately impacting the organization's ability to achieve its objectives. It is a critical consideration within the risk management policies of AIs and is recognized as one of the eight inherent risks that must be assessed and managed according to the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) requirements. Furthermore, reputation risk is identified as a material risk area that should be addressed in risk management reports and must be factored into the risk appetite framework of an AI. Overall, managing reputation risk is essential for AIs to maintain stakeholder trust and ensure long-term success.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 165, "prompt_tokens": 548, "total_tokens": 713, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
