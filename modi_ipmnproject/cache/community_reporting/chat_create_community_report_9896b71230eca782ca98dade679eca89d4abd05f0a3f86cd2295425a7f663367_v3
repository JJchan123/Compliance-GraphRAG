This risk is particularly significant for Authorized Institutions (AIs) as it must be managed within their risk management frameworks, especially when introducing new products or services. Effective management of operational risk is essential for compliance with regulatory standards and maintaining the integrity of financial operations.

This risk is crucial for AIs, especially when launching new products or services, as it can directly affect their long-term objectives and performance.

High inherent risk suggests a significant potential for loss, necessitating robust risk management systems, while moderate and low inherent risks indicate manageable levels of risk. This classification is vital for AIs to understand their risk profiles and allocate resources effectively.
