Central to this ecosystem are the Board of Directors and its designated committees, such as the Audit Committee and other Board-level committees, which provide governance oversight and approve critical policies and appointments. The Compliance Function, led by the Head of Compliance, operates independently to ensure adherence to legislation, manage compliance risks including AML/CFT, and implement compliance policies. The Internal Control Unit, reporting independently to senior management, conducts compliance monitoring and internal audits to assure effectiveness of controls and risk management. Policies, procedures, and limits are established and monitored to manage risks, with clear accountability and independent oversight.
