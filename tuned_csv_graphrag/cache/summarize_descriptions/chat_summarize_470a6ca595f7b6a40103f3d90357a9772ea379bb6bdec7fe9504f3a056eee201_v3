This evaluation ensures that directors possess the necessary qualifications, integrity, and competence to effectively govern these institutions in accordance with regulatory standards. Furthermore, the HKMA holds directors accountable for compliance failures, particularly in the areas of Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Counter-Financing of Terrorism (CFT). In cases where directors fail to meet AML/CFT obligations, the HKMA may impose supervisory and enforcement measures to mitigate risks and uphold the integrity of the financial system. Through these responsibilities, the HKMA ensures that directors maintain high standards of governance and contribute to the soundness and stability of Hong Kong’s financial sector.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 160, "prompt_tokens": 284, "total_tokens": 444, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
