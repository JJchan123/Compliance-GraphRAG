In the context of anti-money laundering and counter-financing of terrorism (AML/CFT) compliance, Authorized Institutions are responsible for verifying the identity of State-Owned Enterprises or their subsidiaries when these entities appear within ownership chains. This verification is considered sufficient for AML/CFT purposes, enabling Authorized Institutions to streamline their due diligence efforts while maintaining regulatory compliance. This approach reflects a risk-based framework that balances effective governance with operational efficiency when dealing with SOEs in low-risk environments.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 131, "prompt_tokens": 321, "total_tokens": 452, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
