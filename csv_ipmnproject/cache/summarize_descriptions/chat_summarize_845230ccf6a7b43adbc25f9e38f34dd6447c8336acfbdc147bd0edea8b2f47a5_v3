These risks necessitate early identification and management to mitigate potential impacts. They may not yet be fully understood or quantified, which poses challenges for addressing the eight inherent risks identified by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA). Emerging risks can arise from various factors, including shifts in the operating environment, changes in financial markets, and evolving business conditions or regulatory landscapes. Consequently, it is essential for the Board and senior management of organizations to maintain ongoing evaluation and awareness of these risks. Proactive identification and management practices are crucial to ensure the stability and operational integrity of organizations in the face of these dynamic challenges.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 154, "prompt_tokens": 368, "total_tokens": 522, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
