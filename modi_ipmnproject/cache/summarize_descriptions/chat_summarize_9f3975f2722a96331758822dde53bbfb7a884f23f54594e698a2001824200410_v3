This risk affects the value of financial instruments held by AIs and is a critical factor that necessitates careful monitoring and reporting within risk management frameworks. According to the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA), interest rate risk is classified as one of the eight inherent risks that AIs must actively manage and report on. The assessment of this risk includes various components such as repricing risk, basis risk, options risk, and yield curve risk, all of which can significantly influence an AI's funding strategy and overall business strategy. Therefore, effective management of interest rate risk is essential for maintaining the financial stability and compliance of AIs in accordance with regulatory standards set by the HKMA.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 161, "prompt_tokens": 520, "total_tokens": 681, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
