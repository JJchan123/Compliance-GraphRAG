It synthesizes the inherent risk levels associated with these activities and the adequacy of the institution’s risk management systems. This profile reflects a balanced judgment that considers both the inherent risks and the quality of risk controls in place, as well as the overall direction or trend of these risks. The Composite Risk Profile is categorized into three levels—“low,” “moderate,” or “high”—to provide a clear summary of the institution’s risk exposure and management effectiveness across its significant business activities. This assessment plays a critical role in the HKMA’s supervisory framework, enabling effective governance and risk management oversight within financial organizations.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 159, "prompt_tokens": 330, "total_tokens": 489, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
