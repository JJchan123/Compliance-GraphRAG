It refers to the potential loss in value or financial condition resulting from negative public opinion, adverse perception, or damage to an AI’s reputation. This risk can arise whether the negative publicity is true or unfounded and may lead to a decline in the customer base, costly litigation, revenue reductions, or difficulties in maintaining existing or establishing new business relationships. Market rumors and public sentiment significantly influence reputation risk. Additionally, evolving factors such as climate risk can exacerbate reputation risk by shifting consumer and market preferences toward environmentally sustainable products and business practices. Overall, reputation risk is a critical component of an AI’s risk profile and is integral to risk assessments and reporting frameworks mandated by the HKMA.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 170, "prompt_tokens": 629, "total_tokens": 799, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
