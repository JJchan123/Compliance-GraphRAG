The Risk-Based Supervisory Framework provides a structured, forward-looking methodology to assess the risk profiles of AIs, enabling targeted supervisory efforts on areas of greatest risk. The Risk-Focused Examination is a critical on-site supervisory activity conducted by examination teams and examiners, evaluating the robustness of AIs' risk management systems, including AML/CFT controls. Findings from these examinations are documented in the Report of Examination, which directly influences the CAMEL rating system, a comprehensive assessment of an AI's safety and soundness. The relationships among these entities illustrate a tightly integrated ecosystem where supervisory methodologies, examination processes, and risk assessment tools collectively ensure effective governance, risk control, and regulatory compliance within the banking sector.\",\n  \"findings\": [\n    {\n      \"summary\": \"Risk-Based Supervisory Framework as the foundation for targeted supervision\",\n      \"explanation\": \"The Risk-Based Supervisory Framework serves as the foundational methodology adopted by the HKMA to provide a forward-looking view of the risk profiles of Authorized Institutions. By focusing supervisory resources on areas of greatest risk, this framework promotes early identification of emerging risks and supports efficient allocation of supervisory efforts. It underpins the entire supervisory ecosystem by guiding the prioritization and depth of examinations conducted on AIs, ensuring that regulatory oversight is both effective and resource-efficient. This framework's central role is evidenced by its direct use of AI risk profiles to focus supervision [Data: Entities (2); Relationships (10)].\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"summary\": \"Risk-Focused Examination as a critical supervisory process\",\n      \"explanation\": \"The Risk-Focused Examination is a targeted, on-site supervisory process that evaluates the quality, effectiveness, and robustness of an AI's risk management systems and internal controls. It is particularly emphasized for AIs with higher risks related to money laundering and terrorist financing (ML/TF), where examinations are more frequent and comprehensive. This examination process directly informs the assignment of risk management ratings, which are integral to the CAMEL rating framework assessing overall AI safety and soundness.

Individual Examiners within these teams carry out evaluations and assign risk management ratings based on their findings. Their role is pivotal in executing the supervisory methodology, ensuring that assessments are thorough and that the supervisory objectives of the HKMA are met.
