These measures include issuing letters and warnings, requiring remedial action plans, and imposing remedial orders to address identified deficiencies. In cases of serious contraventions under the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing Ordinance (AMLO), the HKMA may escalate enforcement actions by recommending prosecution, imposing pecuniary penalties, and issuing public reprimands. The HKMA’s enforcement approach takes into account the level of cooperation from the institutions when determining sanctions, aiming both to penalize non-compliance and to deter financial crime. Overall, these enforcement measures serve to reinforce regulatory compliance, uphold the integrity of the financial system, and promote effective governance within the banking sector in Hong Kong.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 183, "prompt_tokens": 430, "total_tokens": 613, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
