The Board of Directors sets the overall risk management strategies, approves the risk appetite framework, and provides ongoing oversight of Senior Management’s execution of these strategies and policies. It is responsible for periodically assessing the robustness of risk appetite frameworks, governance policies, and controls to ensure they remain effective and aligned with organizational objectives.\n\nSenior Management operates under the Board’s oversight, implementing and managing day-to-day risk management systems, processes, and procedures. They support the Board by ensuring adherence to established risk limits, timely reporting of emerging risks, and maintaining vertical communication flows of risk-related information to facilitate coordinated decision-making. Senior Management is also delegated authority by the Board to approve detailed operating procedures related to risk management and to manage resource adequacy and risk considerations, particularly in processes such as new product approval.\n\nTogether, the Board of Directors and Senior Management collaborate actively to develop, implement, and promote the organization’s risk appetite framework and risk culture. The Board reviews and oversees reports from Senior Management on risk exposures, management activities, and risk culture, ensuring that risk governance is effective and that risk management policies are properly executed. This dynamic reflects a clear division of responsibilities where the Board provides strategic direction and oversight, while Senior Management handles operational execution and risk monitoring, ensuring robust governance and risk mitigation throughout the organization.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 277, "prompt_tokens": 610, "total_tokens": 887, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
