Each type of risk influences the others, creating a complex web that AIs must navigate to maintain regulatory adherence. For instance, credit risk can exacerbate liquidity risk if borrowers default, leading to a potential liquidity crisis for the institution. This interconnectedness necessitates a comprehensive risk management approach that considers all inherent risks simultaneously to safeguard the financial stability of AIs.

The HKMA emphasizes that these systems must be robust enough to identify, assess, and mitigate risks, ensuring compliance with regulatory standards. The integration of risk management systems with the CAMEL rating framework allows for a comprehensive evaluation of an institution's operational health and regulatory adherence.

This system evaluates various risk management ratings, providing a comprehensive overview of an institution's operational soundness.
