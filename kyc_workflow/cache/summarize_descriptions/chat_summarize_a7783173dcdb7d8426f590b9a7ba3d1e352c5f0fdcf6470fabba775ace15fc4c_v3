This approach enables AIs to tailor their anti-money laundering and counter-financing of terrorism (AML/CFT) measures—including customer due diligence, verification procedures, and transaction monitoring—proportionate to the assessed level of risk posed by customers, transactions, jurisdictions, and specific arrangements such as trust and nominee structures.\n\nUnder this framework, AIs apply enhanced due diligence for higher-risk customers and transactions, while allowing simplified verification and monitoring processes for lower-risk cases, ensuring efficient allocation of resources. The approach mandates the use of management information system (MIS) reports to comprehensively monitor both cash and non-cash transactions, facilitating the identification of unusual activities that trigger further investigation. It also requires clear documentation of policies, decisions on waivers, exceptions, and any deviations within institutional and group-level policies to maintain transparency and accountability.\n\nOverall, the risk-based approach provides Authorized Institutions with the flexibility to focus supervisory and risk management efforts where they are most needed, enhancing the effectiveness of AML/CFT controls while ensuring compliance with regulatory expectations.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 246, "prompt_tokens": 749, "total_tokens": 995, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
