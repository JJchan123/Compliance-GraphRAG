for supervising authorized institutions (AIs) in Hong Kong, including overseeing their compliance with anti-money laundering and counter-financing of terrorism (AML/CFT) requirements, and promoting financial inclusion through risk-based approaches.)##\n(\"entity\"<|>AUTHORIZED INSTITUTION<|>AUTHORIZED INSTITUTION<|>Authorized Institutions (AIs) are financial institutions regulated by the HKMA, required to maintain robust AML/CFT systems in compliance with legal and regulatory requirements, and to adopt risk-based approaches to customer due diligence while avoiding financial exclusion of bona fide customers.)##\n(\"entity\"<|>AML/CFT SYSTEM<|>AML/CFT SYSTEM<|>AML/CFT systems are frameworks implemented by Authorized Institutions to prevent, detect, and report money laundering and terrorist financing activities, including customer due diligence (CDD), risk assessment, transaction monitoring, and reporting suspicious activities.)##\n(\"entity\"<|>RISK-BASED APPROACH (RBA)<|>RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK<|>The risk-based approach (RBA) is a framework adopted by Authorized Institutions to differentiate risks among customers and transactions, applying proportional and appropriate AML/CFT measures based on assessed risk levels to effectively mitigate financial crime risks without causing undue burden or financial exclusion.)##\n(\"entity\"<|>CUSTOMER DUE DILIGENCE (CDD)<|>RISK MANAGEMENT POLICY<|>Customer due diligence (CDD) is a set of procedures used by Authorized Institutions to identify and verify the identity of customers, assess their risk profiles, and apply risk mitigating measures proportionate to the level of money laundering and terrorist financing risk posed by the customer.)##\n(\"entity\"<|>FINANCIAL INCLUSION<|>FINANCIAL SECTOR STAKEHOLDER<|>Financial inclusion refers to the principle and practice of ensuring that bona fide businesses and individuals have access to basic banking services, with a focus on avoiding financial exclusion while maintaining effective AML/CFT controls.)##\n(\"entity\"<|>SUPERVISORY MEASURE<|>SUPERVISORY MEASURE<|>Supervisory measures are actions taken by the HKMA to ensure Authorized Institutions comply with AML/CFT requirements, including monitoring the robustness of AML/CFT systems and adherence to risk-based approaches.)##\n(\"entity\"<|>ENFORCEMENT MEASURE<|>ENFORCEMENT MEASURE<|>Enforcement measures are regulatory actions that may be imposed by the HKMA on Authorized Institutions for non-compliance with AML/CFT requirements, including penalties or other corrective actions.)##\n(\"entity\"<|>FINANCIAL CRIME<|>FINANCIAL CRIME<|>Financial crime includes money laundering and terrorist financing activities that AML/CFT systems aim to prevent, detect, and mitigate within the banking sector.)##\n\n(\"relationship\"<|>HKMA<|>AUTHORIZED INSTITUTION<|>The HKMA supervises Authorized Institutions to ensure they maintain robust AML/CFT systems and comply with relevant
