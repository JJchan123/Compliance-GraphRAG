This type of risk is a critical concern for organizations, particularly for Authorized Institutions (AIs), as it is one of the eight inherent risks that must be effectively managed in accordance with the guidelines set forth by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA). Operational risk is not only a key inherent risk that organizations must address, but it is also a significant factor assessed during the supervisory process. Furthermore, it is essential for AIs to consider operational risk in their risk assessments, especially when evaluating new initiatives. Overall, managing operational risk is vital for ensuring the stability and compliance of financial institutions within the regulatory framework established by the HKMA.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 154, "prompt_tokens": 516, "total_tokens": 670, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
