Key entities include the risk profiling exercise, trigger events such as mergers or acquisitions, and risk-focused examinations. Relationships among these entities illustrate how trigger events prompt updates in risk profiles and influence the frequency and scope of supervisory examinations. This interconnected framework ensures that supervisory efforts are dynamically adjusted to address evolving ML/TF risks within financial institutions.\",\n  \"findings\": [\n    {\n      \"summary\": \"Risk Profiling as a Core Supervisory Tool\",\n      \"explanation\": \"Risk profiling is a periodic exercise conducted by the HKMA to assess and rate ML/TF risks associated with individual Authorized Institutions. It combines risk and impact ratings to determine the appropriate intensity and focus of supervisory engagement. This process is fundamental in informing the frequency and scope of supervisory examinations, thereby optimizing regulatory oversight to mitigate ML/TF threats effectively within the financial sector. The high degree of this entity (degree 8) underscores its central role in the community [Data: Entities (232)].\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"summary\": \"Impact of Trigger Events on Risk Profiles\",\n      \"explanation\": \"Trigger events, including mergers, acquisitions, or changes in business models, can significantly affect the risk profiles of Authorized Institutions. These events prompt updates to the risk profiling exercise, ensuring that the HKMA's supervisory focus remains aligned with the current risk landscape.
