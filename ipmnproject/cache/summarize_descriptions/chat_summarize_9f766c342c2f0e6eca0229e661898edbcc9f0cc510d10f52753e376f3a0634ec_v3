These AI systems are designed to enhance risk measurement and assessment methodologies, thereby improving the overall effectiveness of decision-making. They are increasingly being utilized to launch new products and services, necessitating the establishment of new product approval policies to ensure compliance and efficacy.\n\nOn the other hand, in the banking sector, \"AIs\" stands for Authorized Institutions, which include banks and other financial entities regulated by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA). These institutions are required to adhere to specific guidelines and standards set forth by the HKMA, particularly concerning risk management frameworks. AIs are expected to manage various inherent risks associated with their business activities effectively. They are also subject to the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT) regulations, which are enforced by the HKMA and the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing Ordinance (AMLO).\n\nAuthorized Institutions are supervised by the HKMA to ensure compliance with these regulations and to maintain the integrity of the financial system. This supervision includes the implementation of risk management practices that align with the guidelines established by the Monetary Authority (MA). As such, AIs must navigate a complex landscape of regulatory requirements while managing financial activities and associated risks within their operational frameworks.\n\nIn summary, \"AIS\" refers to both advanced Artificial Intelligence systems that enhance risk management and decision-making, as well as Authorized Institutions in the banking sector that are governed by stringent regulatory standards to ensure effective risk management and compliance with AML/CFT regulations. Both interpretations highlight the importance of risk assessment and management in their respective fields, underscoring the critical role that technology and regulation play in fostering a secure and efficient financial environment.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 385, "prompt_tokens": 383, "total_tokens": 768, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
