Shell banks are characterized by their lack of physical presence and absence of regulatory affiliation, making them highly susceptible to misuse for illicit activities such as money laundering and terrorist financing. As part of their anti-money laundering (AML) risk assessment processes, Authorized Institutions must thoroughly evaluate whether respondent banks, including potential shell banks, are authorized to open accounts or conduct transactions. Furthermore, Authorized Institutions are required to avoid correspondent relationships not only directly with shell banks but also with banks known to permit the use of shell banks, thereby mitigating exposure to regulatory and reputational risks. This comprehensive approach ensures that Authorized Institutions maintain robust compliance frameworks aligned with regulatory expectations to prevent financial crime and uphold the integrity of the financial system.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 166, "prompt_tokens": 368, "total_tokens": 534, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
