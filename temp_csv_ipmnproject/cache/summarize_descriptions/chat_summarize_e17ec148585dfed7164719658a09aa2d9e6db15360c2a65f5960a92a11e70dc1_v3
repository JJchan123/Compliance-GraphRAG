This methodology integrates both qualitative and quantitative analyses, including risk management ratings, to evaluate the safety and soundness of AIs from a forward-looking perspective. It emphasizes effective planning and examiner judgment by customizing examination tasks based on the complexity and inherent risks of each AI, thereby focusing supervisory resources on areas of greatest risk to ensure the stability of the banking sector.\n\nThe approach involves gathering detailed information on AIs’ business activities and risk management systems, identifying functional business lines, and assessing inherent risks—including money laundering and terrorist financing (ML/TF) risks—to guide supervisory actions. It integrates these risk assessments into a continuous supervisory cycle through on-site examinations, prudential interviews, and meetings with bank boards. Additionally, the framework aligns with the CAMEL rating system and requires AIs to establish sound systems to manage eight inherent risks while maintaining adequate capital and liquidity relative to their risk profiles. Overall, the Risk-Based Supervisory Approach enables the HKMA to proactively identify, prioritize, and mitigate risks within the banking system, ensuring effective allocation of supervisory resources and promoting financial stability.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 253, "prompt_tokens": 695, "total_tokens": 948, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
