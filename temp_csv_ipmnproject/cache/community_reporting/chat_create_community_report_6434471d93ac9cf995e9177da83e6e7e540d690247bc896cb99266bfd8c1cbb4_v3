Control Functions are independent units responsible for monitoring, controlling, and mitigating risks associated with the institution's activities. Segregation of Duties is a key mechanism that supports the independence and effectiveness of these Control Functions by ensuring responsibilities are separated across different operational areas. This structural relationship is fundamental to maintaining robust risk management and compliance frameworks within financial institutions.\",\n  \"findings\": [\n    {\n      \"summary\": \"Control Functions as independent risk management units\",\n      \"explanation\": \"Control Functions within Authorized Institutions operate independently from business areas to monitor, control, and mitigate risks arising from the institution's activities.
