These systems are designed to manage and mitigate risks in alignment with both regulatory expectations and the institution’s internal risk appetite. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) evaluates these systems during risk-focused on-site examinations and prudential meetings, rating them as \"strong,\" \"acceptable,\" or \"weak\" based on key areas such as management oversight, risk measurement, internal controls, and the adequacy of policies and procedures. Overall, risk management systems serve as the foundational framework within AIs to ensure effective governance and risk mitigation in the financial sector.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 150, "prompt_tokens": 439, "total_tokens": 589, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
