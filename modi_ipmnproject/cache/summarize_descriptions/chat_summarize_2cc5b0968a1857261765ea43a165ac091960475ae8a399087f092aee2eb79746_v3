This classification categorizes risks as low, moderate, or high, based on an analysis of inherent risks and the effectiveness of risk management systems in place. The risk profile serves as a crucial tool for understanding the overall risks an organization faces, which can be influenced by the introduction of new products or services. It encompasses both quantifiable and less quantifiable risks, aligning them with the institution's risk appetite and capacity. Additionally, the risk profile is essential for determining the appropriate level of supervision required for the AI, ensuring that it is adequately prepared to manage the risks it is willing to undertake.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 145, "prompt_tokens": 347, "total_tokens": 492, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
