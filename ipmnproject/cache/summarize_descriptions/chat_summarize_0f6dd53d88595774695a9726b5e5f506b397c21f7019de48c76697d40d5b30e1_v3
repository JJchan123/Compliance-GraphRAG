This approach is designed to ensure that financial institutions effectively identify, measure, monitor, and control risks, thereby promoting financial stability and safeguarding the integrity of the banking system. \n\nIn addition to its evaluative role, the HKMA also issues guidelines based on this risk-based supervisory approach, providing a framework for financial institutions to follow. These guidelines serve as a reference for AIs to enhance their risk management strategies and align with regulatory expectations. By implementing this approach, the HKMA aims to foster a proactive risk management culture within the financial sector, ensuring that institutions are well-prepared to handle potential risks and challenges. \n\nOverall, the HKMA's risk-based supervisory approach reflects its commitment to maintaining a robust and resilient financial system in Hong Kong.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 175, "prompt_tokens": 188, "total_tokens": 363, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
