This type of risk is particularly significant for Authorized Institutions (AIs), as it encompasses the risk of loss stemming from ineffective execution of business strategies. AIs must incorporate strategic risk into their overall risk management processes, as it is one of the eight inherent risks identified by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA). Effective management of strategic risk is crucial for the long-term viability and success of AIs, especially when introducing new products or services. Therefore, understanding and addressing strategic risk is essential for AIs to maintain compliance with regulatory standards and ensure sustainable business operations.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 162, "prompt_tokens": 528, "total_tokens": 690, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
