This assessment is crucial for informing supervisory planning and examination activities, as it encompasses not only the evaluation of inherent risks but also the effectiveness of the institution's risk management systems. By providing a thorough overview of the risks associated with an AI's activities, the Risk Profile plays a critical role in determining the appropriate level of supervision required, thereby facilitating better compliance with regulatory standards and enhancing the overall governance of the institution.

This framework focuses on areas of greatest risk to ensure banking stability, allowing regulators to allocate resources effectively and prioritize supervisory efforts on high-risk areas.
