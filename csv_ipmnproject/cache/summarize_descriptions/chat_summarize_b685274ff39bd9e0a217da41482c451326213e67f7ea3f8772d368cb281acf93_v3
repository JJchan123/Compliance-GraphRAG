This profile is instrumental in informing supervisory planning and examination activities, ensuring that regulatory bodies can effectively monitor and evaluate the institution's risk landscape. Additionally, the risk profile includes an assessment of the level of risk linked to specific activities within the AI, categorizing these risks as low, moderate, or high. This classification is based on the inherent risks present and the effectiveness of the institution's risk management systems. Overall, the RISK PROFILE serves as a critical tool for understanding and managing the diverse risk factors that AIs face, thereby facilitating better compliance with regulatory standards and enhancing overall financial stability.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 144, "prompt_tokens": 287, "total_tokens": 431, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
