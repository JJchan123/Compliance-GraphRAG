Key entities include Follow-up Actions, Management Information System (MIS) Reports, Risk Limits, and Documentation. AIs utilize MIS reports to monitor customer transactions, referencing Risk Limits to identify unusual or suspicious activities. Upon detection, AIs undertake Follow-up Actions, which must be thoroughly documented to ensure regulatory compliance and accountability. The relationships among these entities form a structured compliance workflow critical for effective risk mitigation and supervisory oversight.\",\n  \"findings\": [\n    {\n      \"summary\": \"Authorized Institutions' central role in compliance processes\",\n      \"explanation\": \"Authorized Institutions are the primary entities responsible for executing follow-up actions on unusual or suspicious activities identified through ongoing monitoring mechanisms such as MIS reports.
