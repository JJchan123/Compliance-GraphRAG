Specifically, they apply EDD when higher risks are identified, such as with non-account holders, suspicious transactions, or correspondent banks located in jurisdictions that fail to meet international Anti-Money Laundering (AML) standards. Additionally, Authorized Institutions are required to conduct enhanced due diligence for business relationships involving Politically Exposed Persons (PEPs), which includes identifying the source of wealth and funds and performing increased ongoing monitoring.
