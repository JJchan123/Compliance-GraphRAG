      "1.1.1 The objective of the supervisory framework of the HKMA is to provide an effective process to monitor and assess the safety and soundness of AIs on a continuing basis. The process follows a risk-based approach. It consists of a structured methodology designed to establish a forward-looking view on the risk profile of AIs. This permits a direct and specific focus on the areas of greatest risk to an AI. It also enables the HKMA to be more proactive and better positioned to pre-empt any serious threat to the stability of the banking system from any current or emerging risks.\n",
      "\n",
      "1.1.2 The adoption of a well-structured risk-based framework allows the HKMA to continue to deliver consistent, highquality supervision as the banking sector develops and risk profiles of AIs change in reaction to competitive forces. This should also benefit AIs as regulatory effort is focused on high-risk areas warranting management attention.\n",
      "\n",
      "1.2 Key benefits\n",
      "\n",
      "1.2.1 The key benefits for both the HKMA and AIs from this riskbased supervisory framework are:\n",
      "\n",
      "better evaluation of risks through separate assessment of inherent risks and risk management processes; greater emphasis on early identification of emerging risks at individual AIs and on a sectorwide basis; cost-effective use of resources through a sharper focus on risks, which in time should result in examination teams spending less time on site at individual AIs; more utilisation by the HKMA of management information prepared by AIs; a better appreciation by supervisors of the management quality of AIs, the characteristics of their business and the risks they face; enhanced value of the supervisory work performed to both the management of AIs and the supervisors,\n"
