This classification indicates that the AI is characterized by a lower than average probability of incurring potential losses, which may result in little or no financial detriment. Consequently, institutions classified under this category typically do not necessitate extensive reviews or may only require limited scrutiny, reflecting their stable and secure operational status within the financial compliance landscape.

This designation is significant as it suggests that regulatory bodies have confidence in the operational integrity of these institutions, allowing them to operate with minimal oversight.
