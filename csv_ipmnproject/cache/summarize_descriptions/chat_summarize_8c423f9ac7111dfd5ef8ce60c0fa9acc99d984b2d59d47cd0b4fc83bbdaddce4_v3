This risk is a fundamental concern for Authorized Institutions (AIs) and is a critical component of their risk management systems. It is one of the eight inherent risks that AIs must effectively manage, as assessed by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA). The evaluation of credit risk involves analyzing the probability of default by borrowers or counterparties and understanding the financial implications for the AIs in the event of such defaults. Consequently, credit risk remains a key focus within the risk management framework of AIs, necessitating robust strategies to mitigate potential losses associated with borrower non-payment.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 138, "prompt_tokens": 533, "total_tokens": 671, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
