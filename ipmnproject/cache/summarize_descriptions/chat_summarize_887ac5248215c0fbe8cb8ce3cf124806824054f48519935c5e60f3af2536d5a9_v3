The FATF's primary objective is to develop policies that enhance the global financial system's integrity and security. It achieves this by setting guidelines and standards that member countries, including the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA), are encouraged to implement in their national legislation and practices.\n\nAs an international body, the FATF works collaboratively with its member countries to assess and improve their measures against financial crimes. The organization conducts regular evaluations of its members to ensure compliance with its standards, thereby promoting a unified approach to tackling these global issues. The FATF's efforts are vital in fostering international cooperation and coordination in the fight against money laundering and the financing of terrorism, which are significant threats to global security and economic stability.\n\nIn summary, the FATF serves as a key player in the international landscape, guiding nations in their efforts to combat financial crimes through the establishment of robust standards and practices.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 208, "prompt_tokens": 202, "total_tokens": 410, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
