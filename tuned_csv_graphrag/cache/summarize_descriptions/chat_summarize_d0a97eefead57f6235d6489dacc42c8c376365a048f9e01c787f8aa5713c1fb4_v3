The HKMA conducts annual supervisory meetings with these boards following risk-focused on-site examinations, during which it discusses supervisory findings, risk profiles, deficiencies in risk management systems, and prudential concerns. These meetings serve as a critical platform for the HKMA to express supervisory concerns, facilitate dialogue on risk governance, and reinforce the boards’ responsibility in overseeing compliance and risk mitigation within their institutions. This ongoing engagement underscores the HKMA’s commitment to fostering robust governance and effective risk management at the highest organizational level within locally incorporated banks.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 163, "prompt_tokens": 371, "total_tokens": 534, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
