A key component of this approach is the Risk-Focused Examination, which involves conducting targeted evaluations specifically aimed at assessing the effectiveness of an entity’s risk management systems. This examination step ensures that supervisory efforts are concentrated on areas of highest risk, enabling regulators to identify vulnerabilities and verify that appropriate controls and mitigation strategies are in place. In particular, within contexts involving advanced technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI), the Risk-Focused Examination critically evaluates the AI’s risk management system to ensure it effectively manages potential operational, compliance, and strategic risks. Together, these elements form a cohesive supervisory methodology that promotes proactive risk identification, continuous monitoring, and robust governance within financial organizations.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 158, "prompt_tokens": 294, "total_tokens": 452, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
