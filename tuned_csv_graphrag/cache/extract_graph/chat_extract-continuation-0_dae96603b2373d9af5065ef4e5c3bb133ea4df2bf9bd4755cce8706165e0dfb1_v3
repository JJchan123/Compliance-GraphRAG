procedures, controls, and organizational structures established by an AI to identify, measure, monitor, and control risks effectively, ensuring the institution operates within its risk appetite.)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>RISK PROFILE<|>RISK GOVERNANCE<|>The risk profile is a comprehensive summary of the types, levels, and directions of risks faced by an AI, balancing inherent risks with the quality of risk management systems to inform supervisory assessments.)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>RISK MANAGEMENT RATING<|>SUPERVISORY PROCESS<|>The risk management rating is an evaluation assigned by the HKMA based on on-site examinations of an AI’s risk management systems, factored into the management component of the CAMEL rating and potentially influencing other CAMEL components.)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>INSTITUTIONAL OVERVIEW<|>SUPERVISORY PROCESS<|>The Institutional Overview is a dynamic document prepared by supervisors that provides a concise portrait of an AI’s structure, financial condition, business lines, strategy, legal structure, and any problem issues, updated continuously to reflect the current position of the AI.)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>PLANNING AND SCOPE MEMORANDUM<|>SUPERVISORY PROCESS<|>The Planning and Scope Memorandum is a supervisory document prepared to plan and define examination activities tailored to the complexity and risk profile of an AI, guiding the focus of supervisory work.)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>EXAMINATION REPORT<|>SUPERVISORY PROCESS<|>The Examination Report is a formal document produced by the HKMA capturing the findings and results of the on-site examination of an AI, including the review of the CAMEL rating and risk management rating.)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>RISK-FOCUSED EXAMINATION<|>SUPERVISORY PROCESS<|>The risk-focused examination is a supervisory process emphasizing evaluation of the effectiveness of an AI’s risk management systems for each inherent risk type, informing the risk management rating assigned.)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>MANAGEMENT QUALITY<|>SENIOR MANAGEMENT<|>Management quality refers to the capability and effectiveness of an AI’s senior management in overseeing business activities and risk management, as assessed by supervisors during the supervisory process.)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>SUPERVISORY WORK<|>SUPERVISORY PROCESS<|>Supervisory work encompasses the activities performed by the HKMA supervisors, including risk assessment, examinations, and monitoring, aimed at ensuring the safety and soundness of Authorized Institutions.)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>RISK-BASED METHODOLOGY<|>SUPERVISORY PROCESS<|>The risk-based methodology is a structured six-step supervisory approach used by the HKMA to understand the AI, assess risks, plan supervisory work, define examination activities, perform risk-focused examinations, and conduct ongoing off-site supervision.)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>RISK ASSESSMENT NARRATIVE<|>SUPERVISORY PROCESS<|>The Risk Assessment Narrative is a document resulting from the risk assessment exercise that identifies the type, level, and direction of risks of an AI, forming part of the comprehensive risk profile.)  \n##
