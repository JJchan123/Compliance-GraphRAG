Central to the ecosystem are the Board of Directors and Senior Management, who provide overarching oversight and approve risk management policies. The Risk Committee, a delegated governance body primarily composed of independent non-executive directors, supports the Board by overseeing the institution’s risk management framework, including AML/CFT systems. The Chief Risk Officer (CRO), reporting to Senior Management and the Board or its Risk Committee, is responsible for implementing and maintaining risk management practices across business units. The community also includes specialized risk management tools such as risk assessment models and stress testing frameworks, which are reviewed and challenged by the Risk Committee.
