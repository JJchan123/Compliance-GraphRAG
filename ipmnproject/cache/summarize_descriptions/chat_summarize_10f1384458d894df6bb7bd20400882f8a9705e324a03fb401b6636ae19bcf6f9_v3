This evaluation is essential for understanding how these risks may impact business activities and decision-making. The process of risk assessment is not only limited to new offerings but also encompasses a broader evaluation of risks that could affect an organization’s operations.\n\nIn the context of artificial intelligence (AI), risk assessment takes on a specialized role. It is conducted to identify and evaluate the specific risks associated with AI technologies, which is an integral part of the supervisory methodology established by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA). This exercise ensures that organizations are aware of the potential implications of deploying AI systems, allowing them to make informed decisions that align with regulatory expectations and best practices.\n\nOverall, risk assessment serves as a foundational element in the strategic planning and operational management of businesses, particularly in the face of emerging technologies and market changes. By systematically identifying and evaluating risks, organizations can better prepare for uncertainties and enhance their resilience in a dynamic business environment.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 203, "prompt_tokens": 214, "total_tokens": 417, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
