These waivers are applicable when the assessed money laundering risk is low, allowing the institution to streamline verification processes without compromising regulatory standards. To ensure effective governance and risk management, any waiver granted must be explicitly detailed within the Authorized Institution’s internal policies. Furthermore, all decisions to waive verification requirements must be thoroughly documented, providing a clear audit trail that supports compliance oversight and accountability.
