These limits are crucial for ensuring that any breaches are promptly identified and reported, thereby maintaining oversight and control over risk management practices. Specifically, risk limits are defined by the Board of the organization to delineate the maximum level of risk that an Authorized Institution is willing to accept in its operations.
