The key entities include the Capital Requirement Rule, which sets the minimum capital standards for AIs, and the Section 97F Power, a statutory authority enabling the Monetary Authority (MA) to vary these capital requirements after considering the AI's written representations. The relationships indicate that Section 97F Power is a specific legal power within the broader MA powers and directly influences the application of the Capital Requirement Rule to AIs. This framework plays a critical role in financial compliance by allowing regulatory flexibility tailored to individual institutions' circumstances, thereby impacting risk management and supervisory processes.\",\n  \"findings\": [\n    {\n      \"summary\": \"Capital Requirement Rule as a foundational regulatory standard\",\n      \"explanation\": \"The Capital Requirement Rule establishes the minimum capital that an Authorized Institution must hold to ensure financial stability and risk mitigation. This rule is fundamental to the regulatory compliance framework overseen by the HKMA, serving as a baseline for assessing the financial soundness of institutions. By setting these standards, the rule directly influences credit, market, and liquidity risk management practices within financial institutions.
