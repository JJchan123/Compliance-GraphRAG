The HKMA conducts comprehensive supervisory reviews, including on-site examinations, to assess the adequacy, effectiveness, and compliance of these institutions’ AML/CFT systems. Its supervisory framework ensures that Authorized Institutions maintain robust mechanisms to prevent, detect, and report suspicious transactions related to money laundering and terrorist financing. To safeguard the financial system from ML/TF risks, the HKMA enforces strict compliance requirements, which may include mandating external auditors’ reports to verify adherence to AML/CFT standards.
