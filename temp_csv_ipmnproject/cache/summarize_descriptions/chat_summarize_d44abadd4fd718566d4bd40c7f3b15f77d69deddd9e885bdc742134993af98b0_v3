This adherence is ensured through effective internal controls, monitoring mechanisms, and adequate procedures established and maintained by the Board and senior management. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) actively monitors compliance during supervisory activities, evaluating Authorized Institutions’ conformity with the Banking Ordinance and other regulatory frameworks. Compliance performance is systematically assessed within the CAMEL rating system, which measures the extent to which AIs meet regulatory standards and supervisory expectations.
