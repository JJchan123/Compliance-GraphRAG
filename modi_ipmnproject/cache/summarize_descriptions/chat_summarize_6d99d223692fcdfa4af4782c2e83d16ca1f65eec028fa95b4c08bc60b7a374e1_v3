This risk is particularly significant as it can adversely affect customer trust, which is essential for the successful operation of AIs. It encompasses various dimensions, including the impact of public perception on new products or services, and is recognized as one of the eight inherent risks assessed by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA). Furthermore, reputation risk is categorized as a material risk area that must be reported in risk management reports, highlighting its importance in the overall risk management framework. As consumer preferences increasingly shift towards environmentally-friendly practices, the potential for reputation risk to escalate becomes more pronounced, necessitating vigilant monitoring and management by AIs to safeguard their market standing and financial performance.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 163, "prompt_tokens": 473, "total_tokens": 636, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
