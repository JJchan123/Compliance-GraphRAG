The key entities include the Client Acceptance Policy, which mandates that private banking customers generally require a banker’s reference and face-to-face meetings for account opening. Senior management holds approval authority for client acceptance, especially for high-risk or sensitive customers, while compliance or independent control functions provide additional oversight. The Visitation Policy is an exception within the client acceptance framework, allowing account openings without face-to-face meetings in rare cases. These entities and their relationships illustrate a structured governance and risk control environment aimed at mitigating onboarding risks and ensuring compliance with AML/CFT requirements.\",\n  \"findings\": [\n    {\n      \"summary\": \"Client Acceptance Policy as the central governance framework\",\n      \"explanation\": \"The Client Acceptance Policy serves as the foundational governance document guiding the onboarding of private banking customers within Authorized Institutions. It establishes stringent requirements such as the necessity of a banker’s reference and face-to-face meetings for account opening, reflecting a robust approach to customer due diligence and risk management. The policy also delegates approval responsibilities to senior management, particularly for high-risk or sensitive clients, ensuring heightened scrutiny and compliance oversight. This policy framework is critical in mitigating risks related to money laundering and terrorist financing by enforcing rigorous client vetting processes [Data: Entities (328); Relationships (539, 541, 542)].\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"summary\": \"Role of Senior Management in client acceptance approvals\",\n      \"explanation\": \"Senior management plays a pivotal role in the client acceptance process by providing approval for onboarding private banking customers, especially those classified as high-risk or sensitive. This hierarchical oversight ensures that decisions involving potentially higher compliance risks are subject to enhanced scrutiny and accountability.

This policy balances operational flexibility with risk management by allowing deviations from the standard onboarding process only under stringent conditions.
