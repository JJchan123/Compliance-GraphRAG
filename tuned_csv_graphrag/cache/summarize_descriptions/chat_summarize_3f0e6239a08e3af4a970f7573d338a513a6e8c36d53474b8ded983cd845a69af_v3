It is often composed mainly of independent non-executive directors with relevant expertise in risk management, accounting, banking, or the financial industry, and is usually chaired by an independent non-executive director to ensure effective governance and independence.\n\nThe committee’s primary responsibilities include reviewing, approving, and recommending risk management strategies, key risk policies, and the institution’s risk appetite for Board approval at least annually. It exercises delegated authority to approve specified risk management policies and procedures and assesses the adequacy and effectiveness of the AI’s overall risk management framework. This includes oversight of risk assessment models, internal rating systems, new product and service risks, stress testing and scenario analyses, capital and liquidity management strategies, and the institution’s risk culture.\n\nThe Risk Committee receives regular, detailed reports from senior management, particularly the Chief Risk Officer, on the AI’s risk profile, breaches of risk limits, developments affecting risk appetite, and the effectiveness of risk mitigation measures. It also participates actively in reviewing and approving the risk data aggregation and risk reporting frameworks, as well as any significant changes to risk management information systems, thereby supporting the Board in fulfilling its risk governance responsibilities.\n\nIn addition to its standalone functions, the Risk Committee works closely with the Audit Committee to ensure comprehensive oversight of material risks and risk management processes. This collaboration facilitates effective information exchange and ensures independent assessment by the internal audit function, particularly regarding the effectiveness of Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT) systems and other risk-based approaches.\n\nThe Risk Committee is involved in the review and approval of new products or services before launch, ensuring adequate risk management is embedded in the institution’s innovation processes. It also oversees the establishment and maintenance of appropriate infrastructure, resources, and systems for risk management by senior management, ensuring alignment with the institution’s risk appetite and regulatory requirements.\n\nWhile the Board of Directors retains ultimate responsibility and oversight of risk management, the Risk Committee acts as a delegated body with a clear mandate to manage and monitor risk-related activities, submit regular reports to the Board, and provide expert guidance on risk governance. This structure is particularly common in restricted license banks, deposit-taking companies with simpler business models and lower risk profiles, and other locally incorporated Authorized Institutions, ensuring tailored and effective risk oversight aligned with the institution’s complexity and risk environment.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 504, "prompt_tokens": 1076, "total_tokens": 1580, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
