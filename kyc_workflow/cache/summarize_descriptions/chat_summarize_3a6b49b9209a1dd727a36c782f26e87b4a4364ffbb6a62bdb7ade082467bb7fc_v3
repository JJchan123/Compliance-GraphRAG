The HKMA establishes comprehensive guidelines and regulatory frameworks to ensure that Authorized Institutions implement robust anti-money laundering and counter-financing of terrorism (AML/CFT) systems. These institutions are required to maintain detailed customer due diligence documentation, which must be readily available for the HKMA’s supervisory and monitoring purposes. Furthermore, Authorized Institutions must report any suspicious transactions related to terrorist financing directly to the HKMA, reinforcing the regulatory emphasis on preventing financial crimes. Through ongoing supervision, the HKMA ensures that Authorized Institutions adopt risk-based approaches and comply fully with AML/CFT requirements, including proper customer due diligence and appropriate reliance on intermediaries. This regulatory oversight by the HKMA is critical to maintaining the integrity and security of Hong Kong’s financial system.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 172, "prompt_tokens": 381, "total_tokens": 553, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
