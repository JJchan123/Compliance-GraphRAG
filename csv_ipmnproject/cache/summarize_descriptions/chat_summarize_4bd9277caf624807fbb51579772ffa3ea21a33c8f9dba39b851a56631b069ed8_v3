Strategic risk is identified as one of the eight types of inherent risks that the HKMA evaluates during its supervisory processes. This type of risk is crucial for Authorized Institutions (AIs) to manage effectively, as it directly impacts their ability to execute business strategies successfully. Therefore, both the HKMA's supervisory framework and the operational mandates for AIs underscore the importance of addressing strategic risk as a fundamental component of inherent risk management.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 124, "prompt_tokens": 277, "total_tokens": 401, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
