Risk management systems and processes. version: V.3 - 06.10.2017. 5.3.3 The Board or its designated committee(s) and senior management should recognise the biases and assumptions embedded in, and the constraints of, the methods or models chosen (including associated valuation and pricing methodologies) in order to better assess the results generated from those methods or models. They should also satisfy themselves as to the adequacy and appropriateness of the key assumptions, data sources and procedures used to measure or assess the risks. 5.3.4 The accuracy and reliability of a risk measurement method or model should be verified against the actual results through regular back-testing. The measurement method or model (including the underlying assumptions) should also be subject to periodic update to reflect changing market conditions. 5.3.5 AIs should avoid over reliance on any specific risk methodology or model. Modelling and risk management techniques should always be tempered by expert judgement. For example, models that project very high returns on economic capital may arouse concern as to whether this is in fact caused by a deficiency in the models (such as failure to take into account all relevant risks). Where practicable, AIs should use a range of risk measures or tools to provide different views of risk on the same exposures. 5.3.6 Similarly, decisions which determine the level of risks to be taken should not only be based on quantitative information or model outputs, but should also take into account the practical and conceptual limitations of the methods and models adopted, using a qualitative approach which includes expert judgement and critical analysis.
