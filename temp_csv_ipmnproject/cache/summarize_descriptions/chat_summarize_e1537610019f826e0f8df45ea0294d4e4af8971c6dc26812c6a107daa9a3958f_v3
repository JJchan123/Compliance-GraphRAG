It refers to the risk that an AI or financial institution will be unable to meet its short-term financial obligations as they fall due, primarily due to an imbalance between liquid assets and liabilities. This risk encompasses both funding liquidity risk—the inability to liquidate assets or obtain necessary funding—and market liquidity risk, where the AI cannot easily unwind or offset exposures without significantly lowering market prices because of inadequate market depth or market disruptions. Liquidity risk is managed within the institution’s overall risk management framework through setting appropriate risk limits, stress testing, and continuous monitoring to ensure that the AI can meet its obligations without incurring unacceptable losses. The HKMA emphasizes the importance of liquidity risk management as a critical component of an AI’s risk profile and regulatory compliance.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 178, "prompt_tokens": 793, "total_tokens": 971, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
