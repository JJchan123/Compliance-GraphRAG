This approach is characterized by its emphasis on examiner judgment, allowing for the customization of examinations to align with the specific size and activities of the organizations being assessed. \n\nUtilized by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA), the Risk-Based Supervisory Approach focuses on evaluating the risk management processes of authorized institutions (AIs) based on their individual risk profiles.
