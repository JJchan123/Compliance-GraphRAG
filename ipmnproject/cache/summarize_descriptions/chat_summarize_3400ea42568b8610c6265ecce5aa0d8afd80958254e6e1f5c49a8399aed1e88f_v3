This type of risk is particularly significant in environments where complex systems and human interactions are involved, such as in the context of artificial intelligence (AI). The definition encompasses a broad range of factors, highlighting that operational risk is not limited to internal failures but also includes external events that can impact the functioning and reliability of AI systems. \n\nIn summary, operational risk is characterized by its roots in both human and technological elements, emphasizing the importance of robust internal processes and the need for effective management of both staff and systems to mitigate potential losses.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 130, "prompt_tokens": 187, "total_tokens": 317, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
