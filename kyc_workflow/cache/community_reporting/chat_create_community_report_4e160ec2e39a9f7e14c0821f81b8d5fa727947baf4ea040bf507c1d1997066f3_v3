The CDD process involves identifying and verifying customers and beneficial owners through reliable means, including official identity documents and face-to-face interviews. Enhanced due diligence is required for higher-risk customers, especially those linked to jurisdictions with AML/CFT deficiencies. Continuous monitoring of transactions forms part of ongoing due diligence to effectively manage risks. This comprehensive approach ensures transparency and compliance with regulatory standards, forming the backbone of the AML/CFT system within AIs [Data: Entities (57, 78), Relationships (96, 454, 455)].\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"summary\": \"Integration of Customer Information and Identity Verification Processes\",\n      \"explanation\": \"Authorized Institutions collect detailed customer information, including personal data such as name, date of birth, nationality, identity card numbers, occupation, and address, to facilitate due diligence and risk assessment. Identity verification is critical, requiring verification of official documents like identity cards and travel documents recognized by immigration authorities. Immigration officers play a supporting role by verifying identity and nationality through travel documents, enhancing the reliability of the verification process. This integration ensures that AIs maintain accurate and verified customer records, which is essential for effective risk management and regulatory compliance [Data: Entities (262, 59, 79, 89), Relationships (416, 133, 134, 475)].\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"summary\": \"Regulatory Emphasis on Wire Transfer and Currency Exchange Transactions\",\n      \"explanation\": \"Wire transfer and currency exchange transactions are identified as high-risk activities susceptible to financial crime.
