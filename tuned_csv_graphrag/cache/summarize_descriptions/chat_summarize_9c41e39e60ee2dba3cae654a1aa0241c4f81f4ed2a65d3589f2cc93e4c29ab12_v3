This sector includes diverse segments such as private banking, trade finance and trade-related business, international fund transfers, as well as retail and corporate banking, all of which have been identified as having heightened vulnerabilities to ML/TF exploitation. As a key participant in Hong Kong’s anti-money laundering and counter-financing of terrorism (AML/CFT) regime, the banking sector is subject to stringent HKMA supervision and guidance aimed at effectively managing ML/TF risks and ensuring compliance with both international standards and local legislation.
