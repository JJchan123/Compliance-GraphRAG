The key entities include the legislative provision (Section 70A(3)), the enforcement instrument (Notice of Objection), the MA as the regulatory authority, and the controllers of AIs who are subject to this oversight. The relationships illustrate the procedural flow: Section 70A(3) authorizes the MA to issue Notices of Objection to controllers, which can bar them from continuing their roles, thereby reinforcing governance and compliance within the AI community.\",\n  \"findings\": [\n    {\n      \"summary\": \"Section 70A(3) as the legal basis for enforcement actions\",\n      \"explanation\": \"Section 70A(3) provides the statutory authority for the Monetary Authority (MA) to serve a Notice of Objection on any existing controller of an Authorized Institution (AI) who is considered no longer fit and proper. This provision is critical as it underpins the MA's power to intervene in the governance of AIs to uphold regulatory standards and protect the integrity of the financial system.

This mechanism is vital for maintaining robust governance and compliance within AIs, ensuring that only qualified and trustworthy individuals hold significant control positions. The Notice of Objection thus serves as a deterrent and corrective measure within the supervisory framework [Data: Entities (154); Relationships (282, 283)].\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"summary\": \"Controllers as key governance stakeholders subject to regulatory oversight\",\n      \"explanation\": \"Controllers of Authorized Institutions hold significant influence over the institutions' operations and risk management.
