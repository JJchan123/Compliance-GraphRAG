These institutions operate under a comprehensive regulatory framework designed to prevent money laundering, terrorist financing, and other financial crimes. AIs are responsible for implementing robust anti-money laundering and counter-financing of terrorism (AML/CFT) measures, including customer due diligence (CDD), ongoing monitoring of customer activities, and risk assessments. They must verify the identities of customers, principal shareholders, directors, beneficial owners, and account signatories, especially for corporate customers and high-risk individuals such as politically exposed persons (PEPs).\n\nAuthorized Institutions are required to develop and enforce customer acceptance policies that identify and manage higher-risk customers through enhanced due diligence and senior management approval processes. They must maintain up-to-date records, conduct periodic reviews triggered by significant transactions or changes in customer profiles, and document all assessments and compliance actions. AIs also oversee the activities of their overseas branches and subsidiaries, ensuring that equivalent AML/CFT policies and procedures are adopted across jurisdictions, subject to local laws.\n\nIn addition to customer-related controls, AIs manage correspondent banking relationships, wire transfers, currency exchanges, and transactions involving professional intermediaries such as lawyers, accountants, fund managers, custodians, and trustees. They are responsible for verifying the identities of underlying clients in accounts opened through intermediaries or investment schemes and for monitoring and reporting suspicious transactions, including those related to terrorism financing. AIs must apply enhanced due diligence when dealing with jurisdictions that do not fully comply with Financial Action Task Force (FATF) Recommendations.\n\nInternal controls, compliance audits, and risk management systems are integral to an AI’s governance framework, ensuring adherence to legal and regulatory obligations. These institutions must maintain records for at least six years and justify their risk assessments and due diligence procedures to the HKMA or other relevant authorities. Overall, Authorized Institutions play a critical role in Hong Kong’s financial system by safeguarding against financial crime through rigorous regulatory compliance, risk-based customer management, and comprehensive oversight of their operations both locally and internationally.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 413, "prompt_tokens": 2560, "total_tokens": 2973, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
