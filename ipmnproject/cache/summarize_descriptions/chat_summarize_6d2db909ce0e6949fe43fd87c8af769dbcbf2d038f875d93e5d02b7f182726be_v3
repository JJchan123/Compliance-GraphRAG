This process encompasses ongoing assessments and interactions between the HKMA and AIs, ensuring that the institutions adhere to regulatory standards and effectively manage their risks.\n\nKey components of the supervisory process include regular on-site visitations and meetings with the Board of Directors of the AIs. These interactions facilitate direct communication and allow the HKMA to gain insights into the operational and strategic decisions made by the institutions. Through these engagements, the HKMA can assess the effectiveness of risk management practices and ensure that AIs are maintaining sound financial health.\n\nOverall, the supervisory process serves as a critical mechanism for safeguarding the stability of the financial system in Hong Kong, promoting transparency, and fostering a culture of compliance among Authorized Institutions.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 176, "prompt_tokens": 196, "total_tokens": 372, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
