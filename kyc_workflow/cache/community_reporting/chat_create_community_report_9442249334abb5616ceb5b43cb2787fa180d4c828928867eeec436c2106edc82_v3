AIs open and manage client accounts in the names of these intermediaries or investment schemes, ensuring compliance with Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT) policies through robust identity verification systems and controls over funds co-mingling.

Their role includes ensuring that these accounts comply with regulatory requirements, particularly regarding identity verification and fund allocation controls. AIs oversee the implementation of AML/CFT policies by relying on intermediaries' systems and maintaining stringent management practices to mitigate risks associated with client funds. This central position of AIs in the ecosystem underscores their critical responsibility in governance and risk management frameworks under HKMA supervision [Data: Relationships (590, 591, 592, 588)].\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"summary\": \"Professional intermediaries as agents managing client funds and compliance systems\",\n      \"explanation\": \"Professional intermediaries act as agents managing or administering client accounts, unit trusts, mutual funds, and other investment schemes on behalf of clients. They are tasked with implementing reliable identity verification systems and controls to allocate funds accurately within pooled or segregated client accounts. Their systems are essential for satisfying AIs' requirements for client identification and for supporting compliance with AML/CFT regulations. The intermediaries' role is pivotal in ensuring that client funds are properly managed and that risks related to funds co-mingling are effectively mitigated [Data: Entities (356), Relationships (593, 595)].\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"summary\": \"Client accounts as critical nodes requiring stringent AML/CFT controls\",\n      \"explanation\": \"Client accounts, opened by AIs in the name of professional intermediaries or investment schemes, hold pooled or segregated client funds. These accounts are subject to rigorous management practices, including establishing and verifying client identity through reliable systems and continuous transaction monitoring to detect suspicious activities.

This practice necessitates that professional intermediaries have proper systems and controls to allocate funds to individual clients accurately and verify their identities.
