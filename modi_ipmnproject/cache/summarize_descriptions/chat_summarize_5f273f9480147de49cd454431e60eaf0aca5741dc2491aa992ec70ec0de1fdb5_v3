These risk limits are designed to control the AI's exposure to various quantifiable risks, ensuring that its operations remain within an acceptable risk appetite. To effectively manage risk exposures, AIs must establish risk limits that align with their overall risk appetite. Furthermore, the AI actively monitors the application of these risk limits to ensure that its exposures remain consistent with both its risk appetite and its comprehensive risk management strategy.
