It supervises Authorized Institutions (AIs), including locally incorporated banks and financial institutions, through a comprehensive risk-based supervisory framework designed to ensure their safety, soundness, and compliance with statutory and regulatory requirements. This supervisory approach involves continuous monitoring, risk-focused on-site examinations, prudential meetings, and engagement with auditors and boards, employing tools such as the CAMEL rating system and assessments of inherent risks and business activities.\n\nHKMA mandates that Authorized Institutions establish and maintain robust risk management frameworks, governance arrangements, and risk data aggregation and reporting systems to safeguard the financial system. A critical aspect of HKMA’s role is enforcing anti-money laundering (AML) and counter-financing of terrorism (CFT) regulations under relevant laws, including the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing Ordinance (AMLO) and the Banking Ordinance (BO). HKMA issues guidelines, circulars, and supervisory measures to ensure effective implementation of AML/CFT policies, working closely with government bureaux, financial regulators, law enforcement agencies, and international bodies to uphold the integrity and stability of Hong Kong’s banking sector.\n\nThrough its active participation in domestic and international cooperation on AML/CFT enforcement, HKMA plays a key role in combating financial crimes and promoting financial inclusion. It holds regulatory powers to impose enforcement actions, including revoking or suspending AI authorizations when necessary, thereby maintaining a resilient and trustworthy banking environment in Hong Kong.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 318, "prompt_tokens": 2631, "total_tokens": 2949, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
