A key component of this supervisory work is the planning phase, which is integral to a risk-based methodology. This planning involves preparing for the examination of artificial intelligence (AI) systems, ensuring that the potential risks associated with these technologies are adequately identified and managed.\n\nThrough its supervisory work, the HKMA aims to ensure that risks within authorized institutions are not only recognized but also effectively controlled. This proactive approach is essential in maintaining the stability and integrity of the financial system, especially as institutions increasingly integrate advanced technologies like AI into their operations. By focusing on risk identification and control, the HKMA seeks to safeguard the interests of stakeholders and promote a sound financial environment. \n\nIn summary, supervisory work encompasses both the strategic planning necessary for examining AI systems and the ongoing activities of the HKMA to monitor and mitigate risks within financial institutions.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 203, "prompt_tokens": 192, "total_tokens": 395, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
