The Risk-Focused On-Site Examination is a targeted supervisory activity emphasizing the evaluation of an AI's risk profile, relying significantly on the effectiveness of the internal audit function. This examination is a critical component of the broader Continuous Supervisory Process, which also includes the Annual Prudential Meeting—a yearly engagement between HKMA and AI senior management to discuss risk management and prudential concerns. The relationships among these entities illustrate a structured, risk-based supervisory approach aimed at enhancing regulatory compliance and risk management within financial institutions.\",\n  \"findings\": [\n    {\n      \"summary\": \"Risk-Focused On-Site Examination as a core supervisory tool\",\n      \"explanation\": \"The Risk-Focused On-Site Examination is a pivotal supervisory process conducted by the HKMA that concentrates on assessing the risk profile of an Authorized Institution (AI) through targeted on-site inspections. This process allows the HKMA to identify significant risks and supervisory concerns effectively. It emphasizes reliance on the AI's internal audit function when it meets required standards, thereby optimizing supervisory resources and focusing on areas of higher risk. Follow-up visits are conducted to address significant findings or supervisory actions, ensuring continuous oversight and risk mitigation. This examination's high degree of connectivity (degree 7) underscores its central role in the supervisory framework [Data: Entities (66)].\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"summary\": \"Internal Audit Function's influence on supervisory scope\",\n      \"explanation\": \"The effectiveness and acceptability of an AI's internal audit function directly influence the scope and reliance of the HKMA's Risk-Focused On-Site Examination. A robust internal audit function allows the HKMA to place greater reliance on the AI's internal controls and risk management processes, potentially reducing the need for extensive on-site inspection activities. Conversely, weaknesses in the internal audit function may necessitate broader and more intensive supervisory scrutiny. This relationship highlights the importance of strong internal governance within financial institutions to facilitate efficient regulatory oversight [Data: Relationships (183)].\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"summary\": \"Integration of Risk-Focused On-Site Examination within Continuous Supervisory Process\",\n      \"explanation\": \"The Risk-Focused On-Site Examination is integrated as a key component of the Continuous Supervisory Process conducted by the HKMA.
