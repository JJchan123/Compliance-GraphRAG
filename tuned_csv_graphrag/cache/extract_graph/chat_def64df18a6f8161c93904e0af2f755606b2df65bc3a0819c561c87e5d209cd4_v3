It employs a risk-based supervisory approach that includes assessing inherent risks, evaluating risk management systems, and considering the direction of risk over a forward-looking 12-month period to ensure the safety and soundness of AIs.)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>AUTHORIZED INSTITUTION<|>AUTHORIZED INSTITUTION<|>Authorized Institutions (AIs) are financial institutions regulated by the HKMA. They are subject to ongoing supervision that involves assessing inherent risks, risk management systems, and composite risk profiles across significant business activities to maintain their safety and soundness.)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>INHERENT RISK<|>RISK TYPE<|>Inherent risk refers to the risk of loss that could reasonably be expected to arise from a business activity before considering any risk management controls. It is assessed by the HKMA as high, moderate, or low based on potential loss exposure to the AI in the normal course of business.)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>RISK MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS<|>RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK<|>Risk management systems are the controls and processes implemented by an AI to manage inherent risks. These systems are evaluated by the HKMA as \"strong,\" \"acceptable,\" or \"weak\" in areas such as management oversight, policies and procedures, risk measurement, and internal controls.)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>COMPOSITE RISK PROFILE<|>RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK<|>The composite risk profile is a summary judgment by the HKMA that balances the level of inherent risk, the adequacy of risk management systems, and the direction of risk for each significant business activity of an AI. It is classified as \"low,\" \"moderate,\" or \"high.\")  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>DIRECTION OF RISK<|>RISK TYPE<|>The direction of risk is a forward-looking assessment of whether the risk level for a particular activity is \"increasing,\" \"stable,\" or \"decreasing\" over the next 12 months, including risks associated with new products, influencing the composite risk profile.)  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>HKMA<|>AUTHORIZED INSTITUTION<|>The HKMA supervises Authorized Institutions by assessing their inherent risks, risk management systems, and composite risk profiles to ensure their safety and soundness.<|>10)  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>HKMA<|>INHERENT RISK<|>The HKMA evaluates the inherent risks associated with the business activities of Authorized Institutions as part of its supervisory framework.<|>10)  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>HKMA<|>RISK MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS<|>The HKMA assesses the strength of risk management systems in Authorized Institutions to determine their effectiveness in managing inherent risks.<|>10)  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>HKMA<|>COMPOSITE RISK PROFILE<|>The HKMA develops a composite risk profile for each significant business activity of an Authorized Institution by balancing inherent risk, risk management adequacy, and direction of risk.<|>10)  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>INHERENT RISK<|>COMPOSITE RISK PROFILE<|>The level of inherent risk directly influences the composite risk profile assigned to a business activity.<|>9)  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>RISK MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS<|>COMPOSITE RISK PROFILE<|>The adequacy of risk management systems affects the composite risk profile by mitigating or exacerbating inherent risks.<|>9)  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>DIRECTION OF RISK<|>COMPOSITE RISK PROFILE<|>The direction of risk (increasing, stable, or decreasing) influences adjustments to the composite risk profile to reflect forward-looking risk changes.<|>9)  \n<|COMPLETE|>", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 830, "prompt_tokens": 6215, "total_tokens": 7045, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 5760, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
