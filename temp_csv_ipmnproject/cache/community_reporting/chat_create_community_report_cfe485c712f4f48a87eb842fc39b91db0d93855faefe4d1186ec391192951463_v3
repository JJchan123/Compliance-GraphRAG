The Risk Limit Structure is a framework that defines how risk limits are set, communicated, monitored, and reviewed across various organizational levels. It is directly linked to the Board, which holds the responsibility for approving and regularly reassessing this structure in response to market conditions and business strategies. Meanwhile, Business Strategies represent the plans and approaches adopted by the AI to achieve its objectives, which must align with the Risk Limit Structure to manage strategic risk effectively.
