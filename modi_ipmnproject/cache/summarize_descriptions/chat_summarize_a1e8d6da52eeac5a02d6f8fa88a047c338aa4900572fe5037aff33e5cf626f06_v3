This framework ensures alignment with the institution's business and financial plans, guiding decision-making and risk management practices. It encompasses a set of guidelines that articulate the organization's willingness to engage with various risks, establishing a risk appetite statement and defining specific risk limits.\n\nThe framework employs both quantitative and qualitative measures to provide a structured approach to risk management. It includes policies, processes, controls, and systems that facilitate the establishment, communication, and monitoring of the risk appetite. Leadership from the Board and senior management plays a crucial role in driving the implementation and adherence to this framework, ensuring that the organization navigates its risk landscape effectively while pursuing its objectives.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 174, "prompt_tokens": 460, "total_tokens": 634, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
