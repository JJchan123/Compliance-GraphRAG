It employs a risk-based supervisory approach integrated into its overall supervisory process to provide continuous and enhanced supervision of AIs, including on-site visitations, prudential interviews, and meetings with boards of directors of locally incorporated banks.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AUTHORIZED INSTITUTION<|>AUTHORIZED INSTITUTION<|>Authorized Institutions (AIs) are financial institutions regulated by the HKMA. They are subject to ongoing supervision through a risk-based supervisory methodology, including risk assessment narratives, risk management ratings, and on-site examinations to ensure their safety and soundness.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RISK-BASED SUPERVISORY APPROACH<|>SUPERVISORY PROCESS<|>The risk-based supervisory approach is a circular, continuous supervisory methodology used by the HKMA. It integrates risk assessment, on-site examinations, and supervisory meetings to monitor and assess the risk profile of AIs dynamically and proactively.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RISK ASSESSMENT NARRATIVE<|>SUPERVISORY PROCESS<|>The risk assessment narrative is a document prepared as part of the risk assessment process that details the level and trend of risks, areas of supervisory concern, and provides an overall assessment of the AI. It includes the AI’s risk management rating and comments on consolidated risk management systems and internal and external audit functions.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RISK MANAGEMENT RATING<|>RISK MANAGEMENT POLICY<|>The risk management rating is an evaluation assigned based on the results of risk-focused on-site examinations. It reflects the effectiveness of an AI’s risk management systems and is factored into the CAMEL rating of the AI.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CAMEL RATING<|>SUPERVISORY PROCESS<|>The CAMEL rating is a supervisory rating system used by the HKMA to assess an AI’s financial condition, compliance, risk management systems, and overall soundness. The risk management rating is incorporated into the CAMEL rating.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>INTERNAL AUDIT FUNCTION<|>INTERNAL AUDIT FUNCTION<|>The internal audit function within an AI is assessed by the HKMA for independence and performance. If acceptable, the HKMA places greater reliance on its work, influencing the scope of risk-focused on-site examinations.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ON-SITE VISITATION<|>SUPERVISORY PROCESS<|>On-site visitations are supervisory activities conducted by the HKMA at various phases of the supervisory cycle to obtain current information on the AI’s developments, risk profile changes, new products, and risk management systems.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BOARD OF DIRECTORS<|>BOARD OF DIRECTORS<|>The Board of Directors of locally incorporated banks participates in annual supervisory meetings with the HKMA as part of the supervisory process to discuss the institution’s risk profile and supervisory concerns.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HKMA<|>RISK-BASED SUPERVISORY APPROACH<|>The HKMA employs the risk-based supervisory approach as the core methodology for supervising authorized institutions, enabling continuous and dynamic risk monitoring.<|>10)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HKMA<|>ON-SITE VISITATION<|>The HKMA conducts on-site visitations to authorized institutions as part of its supervisory process to gather current information affecting risk profiles.<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HKMA<|>BOARD OF DIRECTORS<|>The HKMA holds annual supervisory meetings with the boards of directors of locally incorporated banks to discuss supervisory concerns and risk profiles.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>RISK-BASED SUPERVISORY APPROACH<|>RISK ASSESSMENT NARRATIVE<|>The risk-based supervisory approach includes preparing a risk assessment narrative to document risk levels, trends, and supervisory concerns.<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>RISK ASSESSMENT NARRATIVE<|>RISK MANAGEMENT RATING<|>The risk assessment narrative incorporates the AI’s risk management rating derived from risk-focused on-site examination results.<|>10)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>RISK MANAGEMENT RATING<|>CAMEL RATING<|>The risk management rating is factored into the CAMEL rating to reflect the quality of risk management systems in the overall supervisory assessment.<|>10)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>INTERNAL AUDIT FUNCTION<|>RISK-FOCUSED ON-SITE EXAMINATION<|>The assessment of the internal audit function’s independence and performance influences the scope of the HKMA’s risk-focused on-site examinations.<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ON-SITE VISITATION<|>RISK ASSESSMENT NARRATIVE<|>Information gathered during on-site visitations is used to update the risk assessment narrative and reflect current risk profiles.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BOARD OF DIRECTORS<|>SUPERVISORY PROCESS<|>The board of directors participates in supervisory meetings as part of the HKMA’s supervisory process to discuss risk and governance matters.<|>8)\n<|COMPLETE|>", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 1099, "prompt_tokens": 6207, "total_tokens": 7306, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 4992, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
