This approach involves evaluating various inherent risks to establish a forward-looking, comprehensive risk profile of each AI. By doing so, it enables supervisors to focus their efforts and resources on areas presenting the greatest risk, ensuring targeted and effective supervision. Overall, the approach integrates the assessment of inherent risks to determine the overall risk profile of Authorized Institutions, thereby enhancing the precision and efficiency of supervisory activities.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 113, "prompt_tokens": 358, "total_tokens": 471, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
