These limits are crucial for managing the extent of risk that can be undertaken, ensuring that operations remain within acceptable boundaries. \n\nSpecifically, risk limits are designed to regulate the level of risk exposure that AI can engage in, as well as the risk that an organization is willing to accept across its different areas of operation. By setting these thresholds, organizations can effectively manage potential risks associated with their activities, thereby safeguarding their interests and maintaining operational integrity.\n\nIn summary, RISK LIMITS serve as essential guidelines for both AI and organizations, helping to balance risk-taking with risk management to achieve strategic objectives while minimizing potential adverse outcomes.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 154, "prompt_tokens": 224, "total_tokens": 378, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
