The relationships among these entities highlight the importance of comprehensive risk management in maintaining regulatory compliance and financial stability.\",\n    \"findings\": [\n        {\n            \"summary\": \"Inherent Risks as a foundational element\",\n            \"explanation\": \"The concept of inherent risks encompasses eight critical types of risks that AIs must manage according to HKMA guidelines. These include credit risk, market risk, interest rate risk, liquidity risk, operational risk, reputation risk, legal risk, and strategic risk. Each of these risks plays a significant role in the overall risk profile of financial institutions and is essential for compliance with regulatory standards. The HKMA emphasizes that effective management of these risks is crucial for safeguarding financial stability and ensuring that AIs can operate within the regulatory framework.
