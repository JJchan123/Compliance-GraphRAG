The initial step is to identify the level of inherent risk by functional activity for each of the eight inherent risks. The level of inherent risk, which is a judgement call by the case officer, can be assessed as \"high\", \"moderate\" or \"low\". Qualitative as well as quantitative factors will be considered for each functional activity in arriving at the judgement.)\n##\n(HKMA<|>NONE<|>RISK CATEGORIZATION<|>TRUE<|>NONE<|>NONE<|>HKMA categorizes inherent risk levels as high, moderate, or low based on probability and potential loss impact on AI’s capital or earnings.<|>Generally speaking, based on the statistical theory of probability, moderate inherent risk exists when there is an average probability or chance of an adverse impact on an AI’s capital or earnings due to exposure and uncertainty from potential future events within the functional activity. An assessment of high inherent risk would reflect a higher than average probability of potential loss and an assessment of low inherent risk would reflect a lower than average probability.)\n##\n(HKMA<|>NONE<|>RISK IMPACT ASSESSMENT<|>TRUE<|>NONE<|>NONE<|>HKMA considers the degree of potential loss in relation to earnings and capital when deciding the level of inherent risk for AI.<|>In arriving at the level of inherent risk, the degree of potential loss in relation to earnings and capital must also be considered and factored into the decision.)\n##\n(HKMA<|>AI<|>RISK CONSEQUENCES<|>TRUE<|>NONE<|>NONE<|>High inherent risk could reasonably be expected to result in a significant and harmful loss to the AI; moderate inherent risk could result in a loss absorbable in normal business; low inherent risk could result in little or no loss.<|>High inherent risk could reasonably be expected to result in a significant and harmful loss to the AI. Moderate inherent risk could reasonably be expected to result in a loss, which could be absorbed by the AI in the normal course of business and low inherent risk could reasonably be expected to result in little or no loss.)\n<|COMPLETE|>", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 813, "prompt_tokens": 2111, "total_tokens": 2924, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 2048, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
