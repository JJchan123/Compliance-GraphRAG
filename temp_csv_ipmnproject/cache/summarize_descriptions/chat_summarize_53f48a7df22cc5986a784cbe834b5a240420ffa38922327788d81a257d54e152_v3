These inherent risks include credit risk, market risk, interest rate risk, liquidity risk, operational risk, reputation risk, legal risk, and strategic risk. The HKMA evaluates these risks by business activity to determine the overall risk profile of each AI. In addition to these eight categories, AIs are also responsible for identifying and managing any other risks specific to their operations. Collectively, these inherent risks represent the fundamental risk exposures that are intrinsic to the business activities of AIs and form a critical focus of regulatory supervision to ensure financial stability and compliance.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 154, "prompt_tokens": 484, "total_tokens": 638, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
