Central to this framework are the Risk Management Policies, which constitute its foundational component by establishing clear principles, procedures, and limits for effective risk management. These policies operationalize the framework by providing formalized guidelines that govern how risks are managed across the organization, ensuring consistent application of risk controls, compliance with regulatory requirements, and alignment with the organization’s risk appetite.
