This approach recognizes that risks are dynamic and evolve over time due to changes in threats, business models, products, services, customer segments, and technology.<|>5.1.1 The HKMA adopts an RBA in its AML/CFT supervision of AIs. The general principle of risk-based supervision is that supervisory engagement (whether through on-site examination, off-site reviews or otherwise) is graduated according to the ML/TF risks presented by different segments of the banking sector and by individual AIs. Supervisory attention and resources of the HKMA are focused on AIs that are subject to higher ML/TF risks, while maintaining adequate and appropriate levels of engagement with AIs that present lower ML/TF risks. It is essential to recognise that the risks which AIs are exposed to are not static, but likely to change over time as threats evolve; AIs’ business models change; businesses expand to cover new products, services and customer segments; and in response to technological changes.)\n##\n(HKMA<|>BANKING SECTOR<|>RISK ASSESSMENT<|>TRUE<|>NONE<|>NONE<|>HKMA contributes to the periodic Hong Kong ML/TF Risk Assessment, identifying the banking sector as high risk based on supervisory engagement and industry consultation, consistent with international banking risks and Hong Kong’s status as an international financial and trading centre.<|>5.2.1 Effective risk-based supervision requires a thorough understanding of the risks presented by the banking sector, specific segments and individual AIs. The HKMA draws upon a variety of sources in this process, including the Hong Kong ML/TF Risk Assessment, domestic and international typologies and supervisory experience. The HKMA, in consultation with the industry, contributes to the assessment of the banking sector in the overall Hong Kong ML/TF Risk Assessment, which is carried out periodically. The current assessment identifies the banking sector as high risk. The assessment was prepared based on the HKMA’s supervisory engagement with the banking sector and discussions with industry associations, and is in line with the risks presented by banks internationally, in particular taking into account Hong Kong’s status as an international financial and trading centre.)\n<|COMPLETE|>", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 528, "prompt_tokens": 1580, "total_tokens": 2108, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 1024, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
