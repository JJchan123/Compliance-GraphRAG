It categorizes the AI’s risk as \"low,\" \"moderate,\" or \"high\" by integrating and balancing three key factors: the inherent risk levels present in the AI’s operations, the adequacy and effectiveness of its risk management systems, and the direction or trend of risk across all business activities. This aggregated measure provides a holistic assessment of the AI’s risk exposure, enabling a clear understanding of its risk posture by considering both the underlying risks and the institution’s capacity to manage and mitigate those risks over time.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 135, "prompt_tokens": 344, "total_tokens": 479, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
