The assessment of credit risk involves evaluating both the probability of default by the counterparty, obligor or issuer and the exposure or financial impact on the AI in the event of default. 2.2.1 This is the risk to an AI's financial condition resulting from adverse movements in market rates or prices such as foreign exchange rates, commodity or equity prices. 2.3.1 This is the risk to an AI's financial condition resulting from adverse movements in interest rates. 2.4.1 This is the risk that an AI may be unable to meet its obligations as they fall due. This may be caused by \"funding liquidity risk\", i.e. the AI's inability to liquidate assets or to obtain funding to meet its obligations.
