This technique is crucial in understanding the relationship between variables and is widely used in various fields such as finance, engineering, and environmental science. By systematically altering the independent variable, sensitivity analysis helps to identify how changes influence the dependent variable, thereby providing insights into the robustness and reliability of models and predictions.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 92, "prompt_tokens": 199, "total_tokens": 291, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
