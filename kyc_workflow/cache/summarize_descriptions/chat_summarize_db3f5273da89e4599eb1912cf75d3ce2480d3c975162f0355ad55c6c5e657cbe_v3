Specifically, they should immobilize bearer shares whenever practical, thereby preventing the physical transfer of these shares and reducing the potential for misuse linked to their inherent anonymity. Additionally, Authorized Institutions are expected to actively monitor their principal shareholders and obtain declarations from beneficial owners of bearer shares. These steps are critical to enhancing transparency, mitigating risks related to anonymity, and ensuring compliance with regulatory frameworks aimed at preventing illicit activities such as money laundering and fraud. By immobilizing bearer shares and verifying beneficial ownership, Authorized Institutions strengthen governance and risk management within their operations.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 127, "prompt_tokens": 290, "total_tokens": 417, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
