Their role involves applying the wire transfer amount threshold to determine when these requirements apply and conducting verification processes to maintain data accuracy. This central responsibility positions Ordering AIs as key compliance actors within the HKMA supervisory framework, directly impacting the effectiveness of AML/CFT controls related to wire transfers [Data: Entities (390, 395, 400), Relationships (647, 650, 655)].\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"summary\": \"Wire transfer message requirements enforce AML/CFT compliance\",\n      \"explanation\": \"The wire transfer message requirements mandate that transfers of HK$8,000 or more must be accompanied by comprehensive originator information to ensure traceability and transparency.
