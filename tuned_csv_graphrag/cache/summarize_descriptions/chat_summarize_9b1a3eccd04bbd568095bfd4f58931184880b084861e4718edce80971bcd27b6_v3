It operates as the third line of defence, independently evaluating the adequacy and effectiveness of internal controls, risk governance arrangements, and the first and second lines of defence, thereby supporting a strong control environment endorsed by the Board and senior management.\n\nThis function conducts regular and periodic reviews across key operational areas, including the new product approval process, compliance with policies and regulations, and the reliability, accuracy, and timeliness of financial, operational, and regulatory reports. It documents audit procedures, findings, and management responses, ensuring that material weaknesses receive high-level attention and that corrective actions are objectively verified and monitored.\n\nThe internal audit function also plays a critical role in assessing the institution’s Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT) systems and controls, providing independent validation of remedial actions as required by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA). The HKMA assesses the independence and performance of the internal audit function; when deemed satisfactory, the HKMA places greater reliance on its work, which can influence and potentially reduce the scope of risk-focused on-site examinations.\n\nFurthermore, the internal audit function facilitates effective communication and information exchange between the Board, Audit Committee, and Risk Committee by reporting periodically on the effectiveness of risk governance arrangements, risk appetite frameworks, risk measurement techniques, risk management information systems, and internal control systems. It promptly escalates all material risk management deficiencies and weaknesses to senior management and the Board for timely rectification, thereby reinforcing sound risk management and compliance within the AI.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 347, "prompt_tokens": 1069, "total_tokens": 1416, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
