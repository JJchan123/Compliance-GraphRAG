These measures aim to maintain financial stability, protect stakeholders, and ensure adherence to anti-money laundering and counter-financing of terrorism (AML/CFT) requirements. The HKMA employs supervisory measures to address identified risks related to money laundering and terrorist financing (ML/TF), including intensified supervision, issuance of directives, and other regulatory interventions tailored according to the risk profile of each institution.\n\nSuch measures include graduated engagement strategies based on risk levels, requiring AIs to remediate deficiencies in their AML/CFT systems through written notifications to senior management and boards, follow-up on remedial progress, and mandating independent validation of corrective actions. Under the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing Ordinance (AMLO), supervisory measures also encompass public reprimands, orders to take remedial actions by specified deadlines, and the imposition of pecuniary penalties on AIs for contraventions of regulatory provisions. Overall, supervisory measures serve as critical tools for the HKMA to ensure robust compliance frameworks, effective risk management, and the integrity of the financial system.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 257, "prompt_tokens": 511, "total_tokens": 768, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
