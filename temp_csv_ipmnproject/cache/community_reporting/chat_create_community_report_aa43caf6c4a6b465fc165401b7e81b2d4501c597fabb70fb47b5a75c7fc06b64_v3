Risk Measures encompass relevant metrics used to assess risk levels, including economic capital calculations and stress testing results, which support the Board and senior management in monitoring risk against limits. Capital Level represents the amount of capital that the AI needs to maintain after sustaining losses equivalent to the magnitude of measured risks, acting as a buffer to absorb potential losses. The relationship between these entities is critical, as capital level requirements are determined based on risk measures, linking risk assessment directly to capital adequacy and regulatory compliance.\",\n  \"findings\": [\n    {\n      \"summary\": \"Risk Measures provide essential metrics for risk assessment\",\n      \"explanation\": \"Risk Measures include economic capital calculations and stress testing results that are vital for assessing the risk levels faced by financial institutions.
