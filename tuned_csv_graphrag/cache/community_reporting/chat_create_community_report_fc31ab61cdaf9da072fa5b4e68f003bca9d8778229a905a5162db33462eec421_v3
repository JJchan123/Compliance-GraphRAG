The HKMA conducts the Hong Kong ML/TF Risk Assessment, a comprehensive periodic evaluation of money laundering and terrorist financing risks within the sector. The assessment informs supervisory priorities and guides the regulatory framework aimed at mitigating ML/TF risks. The banking sector includes various segments such as private banking, trade finance, international fund transfers, retail, and corporate banking, all recognized for their heightened vulnerabilities.

This assessment is a periodic, comprehensive evaluation developed in consultation with the industry to identify and understand the money laundering and terrorist financing risks across the banking sector. The results of this assessment directly inform the HKMA's supervisory focus and priorities, ensuring that regulatory efforts are aligned with the most significant risks faced by the sector.

This dynamic ensures that the risk assessment remains relevant and reflective of the sector's evolving risk landscape. The findings from the assessment feed back into the sector's supervisory framework, influencing governance arrangements, risk management practices, and compliance requirements.
