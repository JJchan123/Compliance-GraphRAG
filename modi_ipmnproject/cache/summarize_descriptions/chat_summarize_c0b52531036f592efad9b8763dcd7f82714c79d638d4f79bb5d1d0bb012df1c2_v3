This concept is crucial as it guides the establishment of risk limits and informs the risk management strategies and decisions made by the institution. A clearly defined and communicated risk appetite is essential, particularly when introducing new products or services, as it influences the organization's overall risk management practices and policies. By understanding and articulating its risk appetite, an AI can effectively navigate the complexities of risk while pursuing its goals, ensuring that decision-making processes align with its willingness to accept certain levels of risk.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 133, "prompt_tokens": 470, "total_tokens": 603, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
