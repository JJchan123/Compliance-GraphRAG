It defines the types and levels of risk the AI is willing to accept in pursuit of its strategic and business objectives, serving as a cornerstone of the institution’s overall risk governance and management strategy. The framework includes clearly articulated risk appetite statements and quantitative risk limits applicable at both business unit and group levels, as well as qualitative guidance on less quantifiable risks such as legal, reputational, and conduct risks.\n\nThe RAF guides the setting, monitoring, and enforcement of risk limits, ensuring that risk-taking activities align with the AI’s risk capacity, strategic goals, and regulatory requirements. It incorporates forward-looking elements, including financial targets, stress testing, and sensitivity analyses, to provide dynamic assessments of capital, liquidity, and risk positions, and to inform possible management actions consistent with the AI’s recovery plans. Changes to the risk appetite statement require Board approval and proper documentation, reinforcing governance and accountability.\n\nThe framework is embedded throughout the institution, involving leadership from the Board and senior management, as well as management at functional and affiliated entity levels, to foster a strong risk culture. It supports the development and approval of risk management policies and procedures, serves as a benchmark for assessing new products or services, and is subject to periodic review and audit to ensure its effectiveness in design and operation. Overall, the Risk Appetite Framework ensures that the AI’s risk-taking is deliberate, transparent, and aligned with its business objectives and regulatory expectations.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 313, "prompt_tokens": 1304, "total_tokens": 1617, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
