This framework is crucial for guiding decision-making processes and ensuring that risk management aligns with the organization's strategic goals.\n\nDeveloped collaboratively by the Board and senior management, the risk appetite framework establishes the organization's risk-taking capacity. It serves as a foundational element for the organization, particularly in the context of artificial intelligence (AI), by defining how the AI will establish, communicate, and monitor its risk appetite. This ensures that all stakeholders have a clear understanding of the risks involved and the organization's stance on risk-taking.\n\nThe framework encompasses a set of policies and processes that are essential for effective risk management. It outlines the boundaries within which the organization operates, providing guidance on how risks should be approached in relation to the AI's strategic and business plans. By doing so, it helps to ensure that risk considerations are integrated into the organization's overall strategy, allowing for informed decision-making that aligns with its objectives.\n\nIn summary, the risk appetite framework is a vital tool for organizations, particularly those utilizing AI, as it defines the parameters of acceptable risk, facilitates communication about risk management, and supports the alignment of risk-taking with strategic goals.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 256, "prompt_tokens": 242, "total_tokens": 498, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
