The key entities include intermediaries, legal requirements, and intermediary regulation, which collectively define the compliance landscape for AML/CFT and risk management. Intermediaries act as third parties in customer relationships or transactions and are subject to stringent legal and regulatory obligations, including customer due diligence and suspicious transaction reporting. These obligations are critical for AIs to assess and monitor intermediaries effectively, ensuring adherence to FATF standards and local laws. The relationships highlight the regulatory expectations placed on intermediaries to maintain robust AML/CFT controls, which directly impact the governance and risk management frameworks of AIs under HKMA oversight.\",\n  \"findings\": [\n    {\n      \"summary\": \"Intermediaries as critical third-party entities in compliance frameworks\",\n      \"explanation\": \"Intermediaries serve as essential third parties involved in customer relationships or transactions for Authorized Institutions. Their role necessitates that AIs conduct reasonable assessments of intermediaries' customer due diligence procedures and systems. This assessment is vital to ensure that intermediaries comply with applicable regulatory standards and do not introduce undue risk to the financial institution. The degree of connectivity (degree 5) indicates intermediaries' significant position within the compliance ecosystem, influencing risk management and AML/CFT controls within AIs [Data: Entities (135)].\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"summary\": \"Legal requirements impose statutory obligations on intermediaries and AIs\",\n      \"explanation\": \"Legal requirements constitute the statutory obligations that intermediaries and Authorized Institutions must fulfill within their respective jurisdictions. These include mandatory reporting of suspicious transactions and conducting thorough customer due diligence. Compliance with these legal requirements is fundamental to the integrity of the financial system and forms the baseline for supervisory expectations by the HKMA.

This regulatory layer ensures that intermediaries maintain controls consistent with FATF recommendations and local laws, thereby mitigating risks of money laundering and terrorist financing within the banking sector.
