This approach emphasizes effective planning and examiner judgment, customizing supervisory examinations according to the size, activities, and risk profiles of AIs. It integrates both qualitative and quantitative analyses to produce a comprehensive risk profile, which directly influences the CAMEL rating system used by the HKMA.\n\nThe methodology involves a structured, circular, and continuous process comprising multiple key steps: understanding the AI through an Institutional Overview, conducting a detailed Risk Assessment Narrative, planning supervisory work, defining examination activities, performing risk-focused on-site examinations, and maintaining updated institutional overviews. This process enables the HKMA to monitor and assess the types, levels, and directions of risks dynamically and proactively.\n\nCentral to this approach is the focus on allocating supervisory resources efficiently to areas of greatest risk exposure, including inherent risks across eight key categories and risks related to Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT). The HKMA requires AIs to establish sound risk management systems and maintain adequate internal controls for capital adequacy assessment, consistent with the Basel Core Principles.\n\nBy balancing inherent risk levels with the quality of risk management systems, the Risk-Based Supervisory Approach ensures that supervisory efforts are proportionate to the nature and level of risks, particularly focusing on managing money laundering and terrorist financing risks within authorized institutions. This methodology enables the HKMA to conduct effective, risk-focused supervision that is both efficient and adaptive to evolving risk environments.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 319, "prompt_tokens": 836, "total_tokens": 1155, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
