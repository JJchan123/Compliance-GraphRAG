Risk governance defines the structures, roles, and responsibilities for overseeing risk, including customer acceptance policies and risk classification monitoring. The risk management policy operates under this governance framework, detailing specific procedures such as the review frequency and conditions for high-risk customer records to ensure compliance and mitigate risks effectively. The relationship between risk governance and risk management policy establishes a clear oversight and accountability mechanism critical for robust risk control and regulatory compliance.\",\n  \"findings\": [\n    {\n      \"summary\": \"Risk Governance as the Oversight Framework\",\n      \"explanation\": \"Risk governance represents the overarching structure within an Authorized Institution responsible for overseeing and managing risk. It includes defining roles and responsibilities to ensure effective implementation of risk-related policies. Specifically, it encompasses customer acceptance policies and the monitoring of risk classifications, which are essential for identifying and managing potential risks associated with clients. This governance framework ensures accountability and provides the foundation upon which risk management policies are developed and enforced, thereby supporting compliance with regulatory requirements and internal controls [Data: Entities (388)].\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"summary\": \"Risk Management Policy Operationalizes Governance\",\n      \"explanation\": \"The risk management policy functions within the risk governance framework to specify detailed procedures and controls. It includes stipulations such as the frequency and conditions under which high-risk customer records must be reviewed. This ensures ongoing compliance and effective risk mitigation by maintaining up-to-date assessments of customer risk profiles. The policy's detailed guidance supports consistent application of risk controls and aligns with supervisory expectations for managing financial crime risks, including AML/CFT obligations [Data: Entities (301); Relationships (781)].\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"summary\": \"Interdependency Between Risk Governance and Risk Management Policy\",\n      \"explanation\": \"There is a direct relationship where risk governance provides the oversight and accountability framework within which risk management policies are developed and enforced. This interdependency ensures that policies are not standalone documents but are embedded within a structured governance system that monitors their implementation and effectiveness. Such alignment is critical for maintaining robust risk controls and ensuring that risk management practices are responsive to evolving regulatory requirements and emerging risks [Data: Relationships (645)].\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"summary\": \"Focus on High-Risk Customer Monitoring\",\n      \"explanation\": \"A key aspect of the risk management policy is the focus on high-risk customers, requiring specific review frequencies and conditions. This targeted approach reflects the heightened risk these customers pose in terms of money laundering and terrorist financing. Regular and condition-based reviews help in early detection of suspicious activities and ensure that the institution's AML/CFT systems remain effective and compliant with regulatory standards. This focus is integral to the institution's overall risk mitigation strategy [Data: Relationships (781)].\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"summary\": \"Limited Degree of Risk Governance Entity Indicates Specialized Role\",\n      \"explanation\": \"The risk governance entity has a lower degree (2) compared to the risk management policy (8), suggesting that it serves a more specialized or focused role within the community. This may indicate that risk governance is a defined structural framework or committee with specific oversight functions, while the risk management policy encompasses broader procedural content impacting multiple operational areas.
