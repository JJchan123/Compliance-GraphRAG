These tests are crucial for assessing the institution's overall risk profile and resilience, as they help identify vulnerabilities within risk management frameworks. By simulating extreme market conditions, stress tests provide valuable insights into the potential impacts on the AI's financial positions, thereby validating and informing risk management strategies. Overall, stress tests serve as a critical tool for AIs to enhance their understanding of risk and improve their preparedness for economic downturns.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 118, "prompt_tokens": 336, "total_tokens": 454, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
