It encompasses a structured approach that includes key components such as risk assessment, risk mitigation, and ongoing monitoring. This system is particularly relevant in the context of artificial intelligence (AI), where it serves to identify, measure, monitor, and control the risks associated with AI activities.\n\nThe RISK MANAGEMENT SYSTEM operates through established processes and structures that are essential for managing the inherent risks that arise from the deployment and operation of AI technologies. By implementing this system, organizations can effectively navigate the complexities and uncertainties that come with AI, ensuring that potential threats are identified early and addressed appropriately.\n\nIn summary, the RISK MANAGEMENT SYSTEM is integral to fostering a safe and secure environment for AI operations, providing a robust framework for risk management that includes assessment, mitigation, and continuous oversight.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 172, "prompt_tokens": 218, "total_tokens": 390, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
