It is supported by detailed Risk Management Procedures that operationalize policies through structured processes. The function actively employs tools such as Risk-Adjusted Performance Measurement, Risk Measurement and Assessment, Sensitivity Analysis and Stress-Testing, and an Early Warning System to monitor and control various risk exposures. Additionally, the community includes Contingency, Business Continuity and Recovery Planning to ensure operational resilience. The Risk Management Function is subject to regular reviews by the Internal Audit Function to ensure effectiveness and compliance. These entities and their relationships form an integrated framework that supports robust risk management and regulatory compliance within financial institutions.\",\n  \"findings\": [\n    {\n      \"summary\": \"Central role of the Risk Management Function as the second line of defence\",\n      \"explanation\": \"The Risk Management Function is a dedicated unit within Authorized Institutions responsible for identifying, measuring, controlling, assessing, monitoring, and reporting risks on a day-to-day basis. It operates independently from business units to provide objective oversight of risk-taking activities and ensure compliance with regulatory and internal standards. This function also oversees risk management related to new products and services, including approvals and formal procedures, thereby safeguarding the institution's risk profile and compliance. Its role as the second line of defence is critical for maintaining effective risk governance and operational resilience [Data: Entities (199)].\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"summary\": \"Operationalization of risk management through detailed procedures\",\n      \"explanation\": \"Risk Management Procedures translate the policies set by the Risk Management Framework into actionable steps within Authorized Institutions. These procedures include comprehensive risk assessment methodologies, systematic reporting mechanisms, and escalation protocols. They ensure that risk management policies are consistently and effectively implemented, enabling structured identification, monitoring, and mitigation of risks across the institution. This operational framework is essential for maintaining robust risk controls and regulatory adherence [Data: Entities (329); Relationships (644)].\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"summary\": \"Use of Risk-Adjusted Performance Measurement to align incentives with risk management\",\n      \"explanation\": \"Authorized Institutions employ Risk-Adjusted Performance Measurement systems to evaluate the financial performance of business units by adjusting for the risks undertaken. This approach discourages excessive risk-taking by ensuring that rewards are aligned with risk exposure. It facilitates efficient capital allocation and supports assessment of risk management effectiveness and business strategies. The Risk Management Function utilizes this system to inform decision-making and promote prudent risk culture within the institution [Data: Entities (345); Relationships (740)].\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"summary\": \"Comprehensive risk measurement and assessment practices\",\n      \"explanation\": \"The Risk Management Function conducts extensive risk measurement and assessment activities using various methodologies, tools, and techniques. These practices cover a broad spectrum of risks, including those difficult to quantify such as reputation risk. The assessments are aligned with the institution's risk appetite and strategic objectives, enabling informed decision-making and effective risk control. This comprehensive evaluation is fundamental to maintaining the institution's risk profile within acceptable limits [Data: Entities (344); Relationships (739)].\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"summary\": \"Application of sensitivity analysis and stress-testing for proactive risk management\",\n      \"explanation\": \"Sensitivity analysis and stress-testing are analytical techniques employed by the Risk Management Function to evaluate the impact of adverse conditions on the institution's risk profile and financial condition. These tools help identify vulnerabilities under stressed scenarios and support proactive risk mitigation strategies.
