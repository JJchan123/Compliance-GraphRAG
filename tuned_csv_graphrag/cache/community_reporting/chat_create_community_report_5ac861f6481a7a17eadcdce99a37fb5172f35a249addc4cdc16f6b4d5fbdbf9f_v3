The risk management rating, derived from risk-focused on-site examinations and measured against a specific rating scale, is integrated into the CAMEL rating system to provide a comprehensive evaluation of an AI's risk management effectiveness and overall financial soundness.

This approach prioritizes supervisory resources and focus based on the risk profiles of institutions, enabling more targeted and effective oversight.

Specifically, the risk management rating, which evaluates the quality and effectiveness of an AI's risk management systems and internal controls, is incorporated into the CAMEL framework. This integration allows for a forward-looking and dynamic assessment of institutions, improving the anticipation of vulnerabilities and tailoring of supervisory actions [Data: Entities (18, 35, 12, 82); Relationships (24)].\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"summary\": \"Risk management rating based on risk-focused on-site examinations\",\n      \"explanation\": \"The risk management rating assigned to Authorized Institutions is derived from the results of risk-focused on-site examinations conducted by the HKMA.
