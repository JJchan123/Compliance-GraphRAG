These institutions are subject to supervision and regulatory oversight by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA). The primary focus of ALS is on risk management and the implementation of effective supervisory approaches, particularly in the context of Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Counter Financing of Terrorism (CFT) practices.\n\nAuthorized Institutions are required to establish and maintain robust systems to prevent money laundering and terrorist financing, thereby playing a crucial role in the overall AML/CFT regime in Hong Kong. The HKMA provides guidance and feedback to these institutions to ensure compliance with relevant regulations, thereby enhancing their operational safety and soundness. This regulatory framework is designed to foster effective planning and examiner judgment, ensuring that AIs adhere to the highest standards of risk management.\n\nIn summary, ALS encompasses the network of Authorized Institutions that are regulated by the HKMA, emphasizing their responsibilities in implementing effective AML/CFT systems and maintaining compliance with regulatory standards to safeguard the financial system in Hong Kong.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 217, "prompt_tokens": 303, "total_tokens": 520, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
