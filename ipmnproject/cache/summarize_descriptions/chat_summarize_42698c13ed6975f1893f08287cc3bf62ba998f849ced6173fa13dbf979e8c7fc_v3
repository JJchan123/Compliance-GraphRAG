Risk limits are established to control the risks that the AI is willing to take, ensuring that its operations remain within predefined boundaries. These limits serve as a framework for the AI to manage its exposure to various financial risks, which can include market volatility, credit risk, and operational risk.\n\nBy adhering to these risk limits, the AI can effectively mitigate potential losses and maintain a balanced approach to risk-taking. This adherence is essential for the AI to operate responsibly and sustainably within the financial landscape. The implementation of risk limits not only protects the AI's interests but also contributes to the overall stability of the financial system by preventing excessive risk exposure.\n\nIn summary, risk limits play a vital role in guiding AI behavior in financial contexts, ensuring that it operates within safe parameters while managing its risk exposure effectively.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 180, "prompt_tokens": 178, "total_tokens": 358, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
