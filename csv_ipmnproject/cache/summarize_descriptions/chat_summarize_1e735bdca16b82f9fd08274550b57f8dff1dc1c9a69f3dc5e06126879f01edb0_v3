These controls are designed to ensure that risks remain within acceptable bounds, aligning with the institution's overall risk appetite framework and business strategies. The oversight of these risk limits is typically conducted by the Board and specialized committees, which play a crucial role in defining and monitoring these thresholds. By implementing these quantifiable limits, AIs aim to maintain a balanced approach to risk management, ensuring that their operations do not exceed the levels of risk they are willing to accept.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 127, "prompt_tokens": 424, "total_tokens": 551, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
