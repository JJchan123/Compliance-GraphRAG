The HKMA issues the Guideline on Prevention of Money Laundering, which serves as the foundational document for authorized institutions' AML/CFT systems. The Guideline has undergone amendments to incorporate legislative changes such as those from the Organized and Serious Crimes (Amendment) Ordinance 2000 and evolving international standards. A significant external event, the 9/11 terrorist attacks, influenced the HKMA to expand the scope of its AML/CFT framework to explicitly include terrorist financing.

This Guideline sets the standards and requirements for authorized institutions (AIs) under its supervision to establish and maintain effective AML/CFT systems. The HKMA's role is pivotal in defining compliance roles, governance structures, and supervisory methodologies within the banking sector to mitigate financial crime risks.
