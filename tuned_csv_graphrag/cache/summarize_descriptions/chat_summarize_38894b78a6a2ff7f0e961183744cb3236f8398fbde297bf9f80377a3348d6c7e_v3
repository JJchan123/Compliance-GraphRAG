This relationship includes annual prudential meetings where the HKMA discusses key topics such as risk control, business outlook, and other prudential concerns to ensure ongoing effective supervision. Additionally, the HKMA communicates directly with senior management by issuing letters and examination reports that highlight deficiencies related to Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT).
