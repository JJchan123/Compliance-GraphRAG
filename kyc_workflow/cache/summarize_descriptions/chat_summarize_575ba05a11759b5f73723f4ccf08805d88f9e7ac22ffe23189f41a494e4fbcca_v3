These policies serve as a critical component of the institution’s broader anti-money laundering (AML) and compliance framework. By adhering to the Customer Acceptance Policy, Authorized Institutions systematically monitor customer behavior and account activity to detect any indicators of elevated risk. When such indicators arise, the institution is required to reclassify the customer accordingly, ensuring enhanced due diligence and ongoing risk management. This dynamic approach enables Authorized Institutions to maintain effective governance and mitigate financial crime risks by continuously adapting their customer risk profiles in line with observed transactional patterns and regulatory expectations.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 136, "prompt_tokens": 295, "total_tokens": 431, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
