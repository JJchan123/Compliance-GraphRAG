institution that is subject to regulatory supervision and is responsible for conducting customer due diligence, including identity verification and background checks, especially in the context of preventing money laundering and financial crime.)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>NON-FACE-TO-FACE CUSTOMERS<|>RISK TYPE<|>Non-face-to-face customers represent a higher risk type in customer due diligence processes, where the customer is not physically present for identity verification, requiring enhanced measures to mitigate associated risks such as identity fraud and money laundering.)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>CUSTOMER DUE DILIGENCE<|>RISK MANAGEMENT POLICY<|>Customer due diligence is a risk management policy process that involves verifying the identity and background of customers, typically through face-to-face interviews or reliable intermediaries, to prevent financial crime including money laundering.)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>CERTIFICATION OF IDENTITY DOCUMENTS<|>RISK MANAGEMENT POLICY<|>Certification of identity documents is a specific measure within customer due diligence policies where identity documents presented by customers are certified by suitable certifiers to ensure authenticity, especially important for non-face-to-face customers.)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>ON-LINE QUESTIONNAIRES<|>RISK MANAGEMENT POLICY<|>On-line questionnaires are used as a risk mitigation measure requiring customers to provide a wide range of information capable of independent verification, enhancing the effectiveness of customer identification for non-face-to-face account openings.)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>THIRD PARTY INTRODUCTION<|>RISK MANAGEMENT POLICY<|>Third party introduction involves using an intermediary that meets specific criteria to introduce customers to the AI, serving as a control measure to mitigate risks associated with non-face-to-face customers.)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>ONGOING MONITORING<|>RISK MANAGEMENT POLICY<|>Ongoing monitoring refers to continuous review and updating of customer information and transactions, applied equally to face-to-face and non-face-to-face customers to detect and prevent suspicious activities.)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>REFUSAL OF BUSINESS RELATIONSHIP<|>ENFORCEMENT MEASURE<|>Refusal of business relationship is an enforcement measure where the AI may decline to establish a business relationship with a higher risk non-face-to-face customer if adequate face-to-face contact or equivalent verification cannot be achieved.)  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>AUTHORIZED INSTITUTION<|>NON-FACE-TO-FACE CUSTOMERS<|>Authorized
