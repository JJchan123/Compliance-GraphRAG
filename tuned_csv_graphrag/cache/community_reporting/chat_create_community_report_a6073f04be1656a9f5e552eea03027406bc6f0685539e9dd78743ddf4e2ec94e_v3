The Guidance Note explicitly excludes criminal cases from its scope, delineating the boundaries between supervisory oversight and criminal legal proceedings. It also outlines considerations for enforcement actions, emphasizing factors such as cooperation by Authorized Institutions. The relationships between the Guidance Note, enforcement actions, and criminal cases define the regulatory framework's operational limits and supervisory methodologies within the banking sector.\",\n  \"findings\": [\n    {\n      \"summary\": \"The Guidance Note as a central supervisory document\",\n      \"explanation\": \"The Guidance Note serves as a foundational document issued by the HKMA that specifies the supervisory approach to AML/CFT within Authorized Institutions. It provides instructions and clarifications that guide how supervisory processes should be conducted, ensuring consistency and clarity in regulatory expectations. Its centrality in the community is underscored by its multiple relationships with key compliance and enforcement concepts, reflecting its role in shaping governance and risk management frameworks [Data: Entities (297)].\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"summary\": \"Exclusion of criminal cases from the Guidance Note's scope\",\n      \"explanation\": \"The Guidance Note explicitly excludes criminal cases from its application, meaning that legal proceedings involving criminal offenses related to financial crime fall outside the supervisory framework outlined in the document. This distinction clarifies the boundary between administrative supervisory actions and judicial criminal processes, ensuring that enforcement actions under the Guidance Note do not overlap with or impede criminal investigations and prosecutions.
