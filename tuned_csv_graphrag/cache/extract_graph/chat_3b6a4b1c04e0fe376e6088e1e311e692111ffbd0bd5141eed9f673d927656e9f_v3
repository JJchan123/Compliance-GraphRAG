It employs a risk-based supervisory methodology that includes ongoing off-site supervision and periodic on-site examinations to monitor and assess the safety and soundness of AIs, customizing supervisory activities according to the complexity and risk profile of each AI.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AUTHORIZED INSTITUTION<|>AUTHORIZED INSTITUTION<|>Authorized Institutions (AIs) are financial institutions licensed and regulated by the HKMA. They are subject to continuous supervision, including risk assessment and examination activities, to ensure their safety, soundness, and compliance with regulatory requirements.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RISK-BASED SUPERVISORY APPROACH<|>SUPERVISORY PROCESS<|>The risk-based supervisory approach is a structured methodology used by the HKMA to focus supervisory resources on areas of greatest risk within an AI. It involves multiple steps including understanding the AI, assessing risk, planning supervisory work, defining examination activities, conducting risk-focused examinations, and maintaining updated institutional overviews.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RISK ASSESSMENT PROCESS<|>SUPERVISORY PROCESS<|>The risk assessment process is a formal procedure developed by the HKMA to identify the type, level, and direction of all significant risks faced by an AI. It evaluates the level of each of the eight inherent risks by business activity, the adequacy of risk management systems, external risk factors, and concludes with a composite risk level for each business activity and an overall risk profile for the AI.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CAMEL RATING SYSTEM<|>SUPERVISORY PROCESS<|>The CAMEL rating system is a supervisory tool used by the HKMA to assess an AI's financial condition, compliance, risk management systems, and overall operating soundness. The risk management rating derived from risk-focused examinations is incorporated into the management component of the CAMEL rating and may influence other components.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PLANNING AND SCOPE MEMORANDUM<|>SUPERVISORY PROCESS<|>The Planning and Scope Memorandum is a document prepared by the HKMA during the supervisory process to plan supervisory work and define examination activities. It is customized to reflect the complexity and risk profile of the AI.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>INSTITUTIONAL OVERVIEW<|>SUPERVISORY PROCESS<|>The Institutional Overview is a dynamic document produced by the HKMA that provides a concise portrait of an AI's structure, financial condition, business lines, strategy, and any problem issues. It is updated continuously throughout the year to reflect the most current position of the AI.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EIGHT INHERENT RISKS<|>RISK TYPE<|>The eight inherent risks are categories of risk identified by the HKMA to be assessed in the risk assessment process of an AI. These include credit risk, market risk, interest rate risk, liquidity risk, operational risk, reputation risk, legal risk, and strategic risk.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HKMA<|>RISK-BASED SUPERVISORY APPROACH<|>The HKMA employs the risk-based supervisory approach as its methodology to monitor and assess the safety and soundness of authorized institutions, focusing supervisory resources on areas of greatest risk.<|>10)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HKMA<|>RISK ASSESSMENT PROCESS<|>The HKMA developed and implements the risk assessment process as a key component of its supervisory approach to identify and evaluate risks faced by authorized institutions.<|>10)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>RISK-BASED SUPERVISORY APPROACH<|>PLANNING AND SCOPE MEMORANDUM<|>The risk-based supervisory approach uses the Planning and Scope Memorandum to plan supervisory work and define examination activities tailored to the AI's risk profile.<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>RISK-BASED SUPERVISORY APPROACH<|>INSTITUTIONAL OVERVIEW<|>The risk-based supervisory approach relies on the Institutional Overview as a foundational document that is continuously updated to reflect the current status of the AI.<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>RISK ASSESSMENT PROCESS<|>EIGHT INHERENT RISKS<|>The risk assessment process evaluates the level and direction of each of the eight inherent risks for the AI by business activity.<|>10)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>RISK-BASED SUPERVISORY APPROACH<|>CAMEL RATING SYSTEM<|>The risk-based supervisory approach incorporates the risk management rating from risk-focused examinations into the CAMEL rating system to influence the overall supervisory assessment.<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CAMEL RATING SYSTEM<|>AUTHORIZED INSTITUTION<|>The CAMEL rating system assesses the financial condition, compliance, risk management, and operating soundness of authorized institutions.<|>10)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PLANNING AND SCOPE MEMORANDUM<|>AUTHORIZED INSTITUTION<|>The Planning and Scope Memorandum is customized to the complexity and risk profile of the authorized institution to guide supervisory and examination activities.<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>INSTITUTIONAL OVERVIEW<|>AUTHORIZED INSTITUTION<|>The Institutional Overview provides a comprehensive and updated summary of the authorized institution's structure, financial condition, and business activities.<|>9)\n<|COMPLETE|>", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 1155, "prompt_tokens": 6209, "total_tokens": 7364, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 5760, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
