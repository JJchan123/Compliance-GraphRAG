Market risk is specifically identified as one of the eight inherent risks categorized under the broader group of inherent risks by the HKMA. These inherent risks represent fundamental risk categories that the HKMA systematically assesses during its supervisory process to ensure financial institutions maintain robust risk management practices. Market risk, as a key component of these inherent risks, pertains to the potential for financial loss due to fluctuations in market variables such as interest rates, foreign exchange rates, equity prices, and commodity prices. The HKMA’s identification and categorization of market risk within inherent risks underscore its significance in the overall risk assessment and regulatory oversight framework.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 147, "prompt_tokens": 288, "total_tokens": 435, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
