This system plays a crucial role in minimizing the potential impact of various risks associated with business activities. By systematically addressing risks, organizations can enhance their decision-making processes and improve overall resilience.\n\nThe primary function of a risk management system is to provide a structured approach for organizations to recognize potential threats and vulnerabilities. This involves a thorough assessment of both internal and external factors that could pose risks to the organization. Once risks are identified, the system facilitates the evaluation of their likelihood and potential consequences, allowing organizations to prioritize their responses effectively.\n\nIn essence, the risk management system serves as a vital tool for organizations to navigate uncertainties in their operational environment. By implementing such a system, organizations can proactively manage risks, ensuring that they are better prepared to handle adverse situations and capitalize on opportunities that may arise.
