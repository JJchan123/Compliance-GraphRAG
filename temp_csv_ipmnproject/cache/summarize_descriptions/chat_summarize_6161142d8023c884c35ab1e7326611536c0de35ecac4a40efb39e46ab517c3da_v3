This approach requires AIs to assess and differentiate risks associated with customers, transactions, products, and services, enabling the application of appropriate and proportionate anti-money laundering and counter-financing of terrorism (AML/CFT) measures. By focusing supervisory efforts and resources on areas of greatest risk, the methodology enhances the effectiveness and efficiency of combating financial crimes while simultaneously avoiding financial exclusion. Embedded within the HKMA’s AML/CFT policy framework, the risk-based approach ensures that compliance obligations are applied in a manner commensurate with the level of risk, thereby facilitating targeted supervision and risk mitigation without imposing unnecessary burdens on lower-risk activities.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 175, "prompt_tokens": 454, "total_tokens": 629, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
