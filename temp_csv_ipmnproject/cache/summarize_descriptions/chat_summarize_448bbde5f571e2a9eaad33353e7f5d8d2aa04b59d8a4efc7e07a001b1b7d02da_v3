It is recognized as one of the eight inherent risks that Authorized Institutions (AIs) must manage and that the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) assesses and monitors within its supervisory framework. This risk encompasses potential losses due to deterioration in asset quality, such as a high level of classified credits in a loan portfolio, and requires comprehensive evaluation through credit risk assessment systems. These systems include adherence to lending limits, underwriting standards, portfolio policies, and provisioning adequacy to mitigate exposure. Additionally, climate risk may exacerbate credit risk by causing business disruptions that impair borrowers’ capacity to repay. Credit risk is a key component of an AI’s overall risk profile and risk management framework, with risk limits designed to control potential financial losses stemming from borrower defaults. The assessment of credit risk involves evaluating the probability of default and the potential financial impact on the institution, ensuring that risks are effectively identified, monitored, and managed in line with regulatory standards.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 208, "prompt_tokens": 736, "total_tokens": 944, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
