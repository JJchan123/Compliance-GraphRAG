This authority is particularly relevant in the context of corporate customers, where designated individuals are empowered to make decisions or conduct transactions on the company’s behalf. Authorized Institutions are required to identify, verify, and document this authority as part of their customer due diligence processes. Retaining evidence of the authority to act is a critical component of the institution’s risk management framework and compliance with Anti-Money Laundering and Countering the Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT) policies. This ensures that only duly authorized representatives engage in financial activities, thereby supporting effective governance and mitigating risks associated with unauthorized actions.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 151, "prompt_tokens": 306, "total_tokens": 457, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
