Emerging risks are characterized as new or evolving threats that could potentially affect the stability of AIs. These risks are integral to the assessment of inherent risks, which are predefined categories of risk identified by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA). The presence of emerging risks necessitates their consideration in risk assessments, as they can have significant implications for one or more of the eight inherent risks recognized by the HKMA. This relationship underscores the importance of continuously monitoring and evaluating both inherent and emerging risks to ensure robust compliance and stability within the financial sector.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 149, "prompt_tokens": 289, "total_tokens": 438, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
