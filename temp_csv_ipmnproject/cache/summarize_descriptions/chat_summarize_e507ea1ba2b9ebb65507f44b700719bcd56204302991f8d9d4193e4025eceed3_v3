This type of risk is inherently less quantifiable and is therefore monitored primarily through qualitative indicators within the AI’s risk appetite framework. It also encompasses risks related to significant changes in legal documentation, including key documents such as margining requirements and netting arrangements, which can impact the enforceability of contracts and overall regulatory compliance.
