These limits are crucial for ensuring that risks remain within acceptable levels as defined by the organization's risk appetite. Specifically, risk limits are established by artificial intelligence (AI) systems to manage the level of risk that these systems are willing to accept in their business activities. This management is essential for aligning risk exposure with the organization's size, complexity, and prevailing market conditions. Ultimately, these thresholds define the maximum level of risk that can be accepted across various business activities, ensuring that risk exposure remains within acceptable bounds.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 129, "prompt_tokens": 345, "total_tokens": 474, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
