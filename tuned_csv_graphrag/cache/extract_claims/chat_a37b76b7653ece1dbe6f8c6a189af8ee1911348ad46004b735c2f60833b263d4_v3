Rating risk management. version: V.2-23.12.2022. 4.2 Rating scale and integration into CAMEL rating 4.2.1 The rating for risk management, which is assigned taking into account the results of on-site risk-focused examination, is based on a scale of one to five in ascending order of supervisory concern. This rating is assigned to reflect findings within the four elements of sound risk management as outlined in section 3. The risk management rating will be factored into the management component of the CAMEL rating for the AI. It may also influence the rating for one or more of the other CAMEL components. This concept adds a new dimension to the traditional methodology for assessing the CAMEL components and by extension could affect the composite CAMEL rating. The following indicates what this process entails. 4.2.2 The overall risk management rating is incorporated and heavily weighted in relation to the other factors included in the analysis for assessing and rating the management component of CAMEL. If the risk management rating is \"3\" the management component of the CAMEL cannot usually be better than $\" 3 \"$ . 4.2.3 As to how the risk management rating can affect other components of the CAMEL, it is necessary to consider the factors which in the above example led to an overall risk management rating of \"3\". If serious deficiencies were found in the credit risk management process, it may be necessary to rate the asset quality component as \"3\" notwithstanding that the quantitative indicators for portfolio quality may support a \"2\" rating. 4.2.4 Since the risk-based approach views the financial condition of an AI from a forward perspective, the CAMEL rating must also reflect this view. 4.3 Definitions of risk management ratings major types of risk posed by the AI's activities, including those from new products and changing market conditions.
