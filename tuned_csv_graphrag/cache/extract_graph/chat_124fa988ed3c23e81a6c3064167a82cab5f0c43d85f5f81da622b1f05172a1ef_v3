It assesses the effectiveness of risk management processes and internal controls, reports periodically to the Board or its Audit Committee on the effectiveness of risk governance arrangements, risk appetite framework, risk measurement techniques, risk management information systems, and internal control systems. It promptly reports all material risk management deficiencies and weaknesses to the Board and senior management for early rectification, and facilitates effective information exchange between the Audit Committee and Risk Committee.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AUTHORIZED INSTITUTION<|>AUTHORIZED INSTITUTION<|>Authorized Institutions (AIs) are financial institutions regulated by the HKMA, required to implement a risk management framework approved by their Board, maintain effective internal controls, and have an internal audit function to evaluate risk management performance regularly.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BOARD OF DIRECTORS<|>BOARD OF DIRECTORS<|>The Board of Directors is responsible for approving the risk management framework of an AI and overseeing its proper implementation. The Board (or its Audit Committee) receives periodic reports from the internal audit function regarding the effectiveness of risk governance, risk appetite framework, risk measurement, reporting systems, and internal controls, and acts on material risk management deficiencies.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RISK GOVERNANCE<|>RISK GOVERNANCE<|>Risk governance within an AI encompasses the arrangements and frameworks, including the risk appetite framework, risk measurement techniques, risk management information systems, and internal control systems, designed to manage and control risks effectively.

It is part of the overall risk governance arrangements and is subject to periodic assessment by the internal audit function to ensure its design and operation are effective.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RISK LIMIT<|>RISK LIMIT<|>Risk limits are established parameters within the risk management framework to control risk exposures. The internal audit function monitors breaches of risk limits to ensure they are appropriately identified, escalated, and reported.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RISK COMMITTEE<|>RISK COMMITTEE<|>The Risk Committee is a governance body within an AI that works closely with the Audit Committee to oversee risk management processes. Appropriate arrangements, such as periodic meetings, should be in place to facilitate effective information exchange between the Risk Committee and the Audit Committee to ensure all material risks and related processes are subject to oversight.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AUDIT COMMITTEE<|>BOARD OF DIRECTORS<|>The Audit Committee, typically a subcommittee of the Board of Directors, receives periodic reports from the internal audit function on risk governance, risk appetite framework, risk management effectiveness, and internal controls, and collaborates with the Risk Committee to oversee risk management.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>INTERNAL AUDIT FUNCTION<|>BOARD OF DIRECTORS<|>The internal audit function reports periodically to the Board (or its Audit Committee) on the effectiveness of risk governance, risk appetite framework, risk measurement, reporting systems, and internal controls, enabling the Board to oversee risk management effectively.<|>10)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>INTERNAL AUDIT FUNCTION<|>RISK GOVERNANCE<|>The internal audit function assesses and tests the effectiveness of the AI’s risk governance arrangements, including risk appetite framework, risk measurement techniques, and internal control systems.<|>10)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>INTERNAL AUDIT FUNCTION<|>RISK APPETITE FRAMEWORK<|>The internal audit function evaluates the design and operation effectiveness of the AI’s risk appetite framework as part of its risk governance assessment.<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>INTERNAL AUDIT FUNCTION<|>RISK LIMIT<|>The internal audit function monitors breaches of risk limits to ensure they are properly identified, escalated, and reported.<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>INTERNAL AUDIT FUNCTION<|>RISK COMMITTEE<|>The internal audit function facilitates effective exchange of information between the Audit Committee and Risk Committee to ensure comprehensive oversight of material risks and risk management processes.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>RISK COMMITTEE<|>AUDIT COMMITTEE<|>The Risk Committee and Audit Committee maintain appropriate arrangements, such as periodic meetings, to facilitate effective information exchange and joint oversight of risk management.<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BOARD OF DIRECTORS<|>AUTHORIZED INSTITUTION<|>The Board of Directors approves the risk management framework of the AI and oversees its implementation to ensure effective risk management.<|>10)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>INTERNAL AUDIT FUNCTION<|>AUTHORIZED INSTITUTION<|>The internal audit function operates within the AI to independently evaluate the implementation and effectiveness of the risk management framework and internal controls.<|>10)\n<|COMPLETE|>", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 1096, "prompt_tokens": 6216, "total_tokens": 7312, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 5248, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
