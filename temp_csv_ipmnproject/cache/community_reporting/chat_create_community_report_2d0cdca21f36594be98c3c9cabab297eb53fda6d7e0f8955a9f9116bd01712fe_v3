Key entities include merger or acquisition events, business model or scope changes, and the resulting risk profiles of AIs. The HKMA actively monitors mergers, acquisitions, and operational changes as triggers that may alter the risk profiles of AIs, particularly affecting their Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT) risk exposure.
