This approach emphasizes the evaluation of inherent risks, which include credit, market, interest rate, liquidity, operational, legal, reputation, and strategic risks. By focusing on areas of greatest risk, the HKMA aims to ensure banking stability and compliance with regulatory standards. This framework is crucial for guiding supervisory engagements and optimizing resource allocation within the financial sector.
