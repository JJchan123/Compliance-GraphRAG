standards established by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) that provide a comprehensive framework for anti-money laundering (AML) and counter-financing of terrorism (CFT) measures applicable to both financial and non-financial institutions globally.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BASEL CUSTOMER DUE DILIGENCE REQUIREMENTS<|>INTERNATIONAL STANDARD<|>The Basel Customer Due Diligence (CDD) requirements are prudential regulatory standards specifically directed towards banks, recognized as more rigorous than the FATF standards in some respects, tailored to address the risks banks face in relation to money laundering and terrorist financing.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AUTHORIZED INSTITUTION<|>AUTHORIZED INSTITUTION<|>Authorized Institutions (AIs) are financial institutions operating in Hong Kong that are subject to regulatory supervision, required to implement customer due diligence measures and comply with AML/CFT guidelines to prevent financial crime.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RISK-BASED APPROACH<|>RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK<|>The risk-based approach is a framework adopted by Authorized Institutions to apply enhanced due diligence measures for higher risk customers and simplified procedures for lower risk customers, allowing flexibility based on assessed money laundering risks.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HKMA<|>REGULATORY AUTHORITY<|>The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) is the regulatory authority overseeing Authorized Institutions in Hong Kong, responsible for ensuring compliance with AML/CFT guidelines and the prevention of financial crime.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GUIDELINE ON PREVENTION OF MONEY LAUNDERING<|>RISK MANAGEMENT POLICY<|>The Guideline on Prevention of Money Laundering is a regulatory policy framework issued to Authorized Institutions outlining the required measures and principles for customer due diligence and risk management to combat money laundering and terrorist financing.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SUPPLEMENT TO THE GUIDELINE ON PREVENTION OF MONEY LAUNDERING<|>RISK MANAGEMENT POLICY<|>The Supplement to the Guideline on Prevention of Money Laundering provides additional interpretative notes and guidance to Authorized Institutions on implementing customer due diligence and risk-based approaches in compliance with AML/CFT standards.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CUSTOMER DUE DILIGENCE (CDD)<|>AML/CFT SYSTEM<|>Customer Due Diligence (CDD) refers to the processes and procedures implemented by Authorized Institutions to verify the identity of customers and beneficial owners, assess money laundering risks, and apply appropriate due diligence measures accordingly.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MONEY LAUNDERING RISK<|>RISK TYPE<|>Money laundering risk is the potential exposure of Authorized Institutions to financial crime through the processing of illicit funds, requiring assessment and management through enhanced due diligence and risk-based controls.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SIMPLIFIED CUSTOMER DUE DILIGENCE<|>AML/CFT SYSTEM<|>Simplified Customer Due Diligence is a reduced level of verification and monitoring applied by Authorized Institutions to customers or customer types assessed to pose a low risk of money laundering, subject to regulatory acceptance.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ENHANCED CUSTOMER DUE DILIGENCE<|>AML/CFT SYSTEM<|>Enhanced Customer Due Diligence involves more extensive verification and monitoring measures applied by Authorized Institutions to customers or transactions assessed to present a higher risk of money laundering or terrorist financing.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FATF FORTY RECOMMENDATIONS<|>AUTHORIZED INSTITUTION<|>The FATF Forty Recommendations provide the basic AML/CFT framework that Authorized Institutions in Hong Kong are expected to follow to prevent financial crime.<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BASEL CUSTOMER DUE DILIGENCE REQUIREMENTS<|>AUTHORIZED INSTITUTION<|>The Basel CDD requirements impose prudential regulatory standards on Authorized Institutions, especially banks, to implement rigorous customer due diligence measures.<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HKMA<|>AUTHORIZED INSTITUTION<|>The HKMA regulates and supervises Authorized Institutions to ensure compliance with AML/CFT guidelines and prevention of money laundering risks.<|>10)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HKMA<|>GUIDELINE ON PREVENTION OF MONEY LAUNDERING<|>The HKMA issues the Guideline on

proportionate to the assessed money laundering risk.<|>10)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>RISK-BASED APPROACH<|>ENHANCED CUSTOMER DUE DILIGENCE<|>The risk-based approach requires Authorized Institutions to apply enhanced due diligence for customers assessed as higher risk.<|>10)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>RISK-BASED APPROACH<|>SIMPLIFIED CUSTOMER DUE DILIGENCE<|>The risk-based approach allows Authorized Institutions to apply simplified due diligence for customers or customer types assessed as low risk.<|>10)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CUSTOMER DUE DILIGENCE (CDD)<|>MONEY LAUNDERING RISK<|>Customer Due Diligence processes are designed to identify and mitigate money laundering risks faced by Authorized Institutions.<|>10)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>AUTHORIZED INSTITUTION<|>CUSTOMER DUE DILIGENCE
