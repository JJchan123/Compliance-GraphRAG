It serves as a key output of the risk assessment exercise, which is typically the second step in the supervisory process. This narrative summarizes the identification, type, level, and direction (trend) of inherent risks faced by an AI, based on a building-block approach that evaluates each significant activity against inherent risks and the adequacy and effectiveness of the institution’s risk management systems.\n\nThe document forms an integral part of the AI’s overall risk profile, capturing both inherent risks and the institution’s risk management capabilities, including consolidated risk management frameworks as well as internal and external audit functions. It qualitatively assesses management’s effectiveness in controlling risks and highlights key supervisory concerns. Additionally, the Risk Assessment Narrative provides an overall risk management rating and supports the definition of the scope and focus of subsequent risk-focused examinations.\n\nIn essence, the Risk Assessment Narrative offers a detailed and structured summary of the AI’s risk landscape, enabling regulators to monitor risk trends, identify emerging issues, and ensure effective governance and risk management within the financial institution.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 237, "prompt_tokens": 650, "total_tokens": 887, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
