These limits are crucial for ensuring that risk-taking remains within acceptable boundaries, aligning with the organization's overall risk appetite. Specifically, risk limits serve as quantitative measures that delineate the maximum allowable risk exposure for different business units within an AI, thereby facilitating compliance with regulatory standards and internal governance frameworks. Furthermore, these thresholds are documented and require approval from the Board or designated committees, ensuring that the organization's risk exposure is systematically managed and remains within acceptable levels. Overall, risk limits are integral to maintaining a structured approach to risk management, safeguarding the organization against excessive risk-taking.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 148, "prompt_tokens": 413, "total_tokens": 561, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
