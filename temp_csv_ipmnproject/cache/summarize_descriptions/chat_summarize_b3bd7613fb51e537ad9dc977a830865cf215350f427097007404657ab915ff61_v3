This illicit activity poses significant risks that Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT) systems specifically aim to detect and prevent. Financial institutions play a critical role in mitigating these risks by implementing robust AML/CFT measures, which are closely supervised by regulatory authorities such as the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA). These systems are designed to identify suspicious financial transactions and ensure that funds are not channeled to support terrorism, thereby safeguarding the integrity of the financial sector and contributing to broader national and international security efforts.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 130, "prompt_tokens": 286, "total_tokens": 416, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
