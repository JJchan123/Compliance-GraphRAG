This collaborative approach not only aims to improve overall compliance but also has the potential to lead to reduced sanctions in specific circumstances. Furthermore, the HKMA emphasizes the importance of cooperation from AIs during investigations, as this collaboration can significantly influence the enforcement actions taken against these institutions. Through these initiatives, the HKMA seeks to foster a more compliant and cooperative financial environment, ultimately strengthening the integrity of the financial system in Hong Kong.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 129, "prompt_tokens": 283, "total_tokens": 412, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
