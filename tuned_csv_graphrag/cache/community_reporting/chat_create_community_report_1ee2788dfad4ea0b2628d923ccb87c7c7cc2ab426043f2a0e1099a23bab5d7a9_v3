Central to the ecosystem are formalized policies such as the New Product Approval Policy and the Risk Management Policy, which are overseen by the Board or its designated committees, including the Risk Committee. These policies establish comprehensive frameworks for assessing, approving, and monitoring risks associated with new products, services, and overall business activities. Risk limits derived from the institution's Risk Appetite Framework are applied across organizational levels to control exposures, with senior management and the Chief Risk Officer responsible for monitoring adherence. The internal audit function provides additional oversight to ensure compliance and timely reporting of breaches. The management experience level influences the effectiveness of these policies, ensuring alignment with regulatory requirements and sound governance practices. This interconnected structure supports robust risk management, AML/CFT controls, and supervisory engagement within the banking sector.\",\n  \"findings\": [\n    {\n      \"summary\": \"New Product Approval Policy as a critical governance mechanism\",\n      \"explanation\": \"The New Product Approval Policy is a formally documented framework within Authorized Institutions that governs the assessment, approval, and revision of all new products and services prior to launch, including significant changes to existing offerings. It mandates thorough evaluation procedures involving relevant internal functions to ensure comprehensive risk management and control over new product introductions. Approval of the policy and its revisions requires authorization by the Board of Directors or a designated committee with delegated authority. This policy also covers decisions related to entering new markets and adopting innovative products or services, establishing a robust governance mechanism to oversee product lifecycle changes within the institution. This ensures that new product risks are managed proactively and in compliance with regulatory expectations [Data: Entities (305); Relationships (592)].\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"summary\": \"Risk Management Policy as the foundation of risk governance\",\n      \"explanation\": \"The Risk Management Policy is a comprehensive, formalized framework comprising organizational policies, procedures, controls, and limits designed to identify, assess, measure, monitor, report, and control risks arising from the AI’s business activities. It covers all material risks, including financial, non-financial, contingent, off-balance sheet exposures, and risks related to new products and services. The policy aligns with statutory provisions, supervisory standards, codes of conduct, and AML/CFT controls, supporting consistent risk management practices across all risk types. It establishes clear principles, roles, responsibilities, and accountability, specifying lines of authority for business units and principal officers. The policy is regularly reviewed and updated to reflect the AI’s business strategy, operational complexity, past performance, management experience, financial strength, and evolving regulatory obligations.

It is responsible for reviewing and advising on the Risk Management Policy to ensure that the policy is comprehensive, effective, and aligned with the organization's risk appetite and regulatory requirements. Additionally, the Risk Committee monitors adherence to the Risk Management Policy, providing ongoing oversight to ensure compliance and robust risk governance.

These limits define the maximum acceptable level of risk the institution is willing to assume across various risk categories, including those arising from new products, services, or business activities, and extend to specific risks such as AML/CFT exposures. Risk limits are derived from the AI’s overall Risk Appetite Framework and are applied at multiple organizational levels, enabling aggregation and disaggregation of risk exposures to ensure comprehensive oversight. Senior management is responsible for ensuring that risk exposures remain within these established limits, including under stressed conditions, while the Chief Risk Officer actively monitors adherence and reports any material breaches to the Board and the Risk Committee. The internal audit function also monitors breaches to ensure they are identified, escalated, and reported appropriately. Risk limits are regularly reviewed and communicated to relevant staff to maintain effective governance and proactive risk control within the institution’s risk-adjusted performance measurement systems [Data: Entities (43); Relationships (75, 589, 695)].\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"summary\": \"Influence of management experience on risk policy effectiveness\",\n      \"explanation\": \"The qualifications, expertise, and experience of an AI’s management team significantly influence the appropriateness and effectiveness of risk policies and risk management systems.
