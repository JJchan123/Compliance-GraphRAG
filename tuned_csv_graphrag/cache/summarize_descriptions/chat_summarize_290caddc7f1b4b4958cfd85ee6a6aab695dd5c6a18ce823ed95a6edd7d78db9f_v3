Approved by the Board or its delegated committees—such as the Risk Committee—and subject to compliance monitoring by internal audit, these policies ensure that risk-taking activities are managed within the institution’s defined risk appetite and regulatory requirements.\n\nThis policy framework encompasses all material risks, including financial, non-financial (such as reputational risk), contingent, off-balance sheet exposures, and risks related to new products and services. It aligns with statutory provisions, supervisory standards, codes of conduct, and anti-money laundering/combating the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT) controls, supporting consistent risk management practices across all risk types.\n\nThe Risk Management Policy establishes clear principles, roles, responsibilities, and accountability, specifying lines of authority for business units and principal officers. It incorporates risk limits and monitoring mechanisms, including stress-testing and valuation processes, to ensure timely management actions in response to breaches or adverse events. The policy is regularly reviewed and updated to reflect the AI’s business strategy, operational complexity, past performance, management experience, financial strength, and evolving regulatory obligations.\n\nOverall, the Risk Management Policy forms a critical part of the AI’s effective risk management system, overseen by the Board and senior management, to maintain sound governance, ensure compliance, and safeguard the institution’s stability and reputation.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 304, "prompt_tokens": 1304, "total_tokens": 1608, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
