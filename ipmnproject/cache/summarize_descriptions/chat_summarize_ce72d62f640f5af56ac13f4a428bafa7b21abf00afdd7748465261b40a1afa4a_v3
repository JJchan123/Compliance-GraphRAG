This comprehensive system is designed to identify, measure, monitor, and control different types of risks that AIs may encounter. \n\nA robust risk management system encompasses a set of policies, procedures, and controls aimed at managing and mitigating these risks. By implementing such a system, AIs can ensure that they are prepared to address potential challenges and uncertainties in their functioning. The framework not only facilitates the identification of risks but also provides methodologies for assessing their impact and likelihood, enabling AIs to prioritize their responses accordingly.\n\nIn summary, the RISK MANAGEMENT SYSTEM serves as an essential component for AIs, equipping them with the necessary tools and strategies to navigate the complexities of risk in their operations.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 169, "prompt_tokens": 219, "total_tokens": 388, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
