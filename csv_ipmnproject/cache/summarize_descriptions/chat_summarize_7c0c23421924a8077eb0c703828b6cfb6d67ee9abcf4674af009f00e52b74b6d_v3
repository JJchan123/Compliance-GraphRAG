The introduction of new products or services must be carefully aligned with the risk appetite of the organization, which is defined as the level of risk that the institution is willing to accept in pursuit of its objectives. This alignment is essential to ensure that the associated risks remain within acceptable limits. Furthermore, the risk appetite of an Authorized Institution plays a significant role in shaping the evaluation and approval process for these new offerings. It influences how potential risks are assessed and managed, thereby guiding decision-making and ensuring compliance with regulatory standards. Overall, a coherent strategy that integrates the development of new products or services with a clear understanding of risk appetite is vital for maintaining organizational integrity and regulatory compliance.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 161, "prompt_tokens": 274, "total_tokens": 435, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
