This approach ensures that the evaluation aligns with the AI's established risk appetite, promoting a balanced perspective on performance metrics. Additionally, it serves as a system for assessing the performance of various business units within AIs, focusing on the risks associated with their activities. By doing so, it ensures that excessive risk-taking is not rewarded, fostering a culture of responsible risk management and compliance within the organization. This dual focus on both AI performance and business unit activities underscores the importance of integrating risk considerations into performance evaluations to enhance overall organizational effectiveness and regulatory compliance.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 146, "prompt_tokens": 290, "total_tokens": 436, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
