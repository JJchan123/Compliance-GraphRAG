This framework is designed to align with the institution’s strategic objectives, business goals, financial plans, and overall risk-taking capacity. The Board ensures that the Risk Appetite Framework is consistent with the organization’s risk management strategies and is integral to setting risk policies, limits, and capital planning. It receives comprehensive and timely information to monitor the implementation and effectiveness of the framework, including insights derived from stress-testing outcomes. The Board also relies on recommendations from the Risk Committee but retains ultimate authority to approve the framework and any subsequent changes.
