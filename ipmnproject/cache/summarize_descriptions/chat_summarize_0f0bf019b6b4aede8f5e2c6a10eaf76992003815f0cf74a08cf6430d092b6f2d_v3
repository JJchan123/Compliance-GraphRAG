This narrative serves as a comprehensive overview of the identified risks, providing a structured analysis that is essential for effective risk management.\n\nThe primary purpose of the Risk Assessment Narrative is to encapsulate the overall level of risk associated with the AI in question. It plays a vital role in the risk-based supervisory methodology, ensuring that all potential risks are thoroughly documented and assessed. By doing so, it aids stakeholders in understanding the implications of these risks and facilitates informed decision-making regarding the deployment and management of AI technologies.\n\nIn summary, the Risk Assessment Narrative is an indispensable component of the risk assessment process, offering a detailed account of the risks identified in AI systems and contributing significantly to the overarching risk management strategy.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 170, "prompt_tokens": 195, "total_tokens": 365, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
