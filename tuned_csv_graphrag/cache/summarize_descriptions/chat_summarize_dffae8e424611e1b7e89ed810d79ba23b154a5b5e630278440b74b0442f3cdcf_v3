It defines the organization's risk tolerance and serves as the guiding structure for setting specific Risk Limits. These Risk Limits are quantitative or qualitative thresholds designed to control and manage risk exposures, ensuring they remain within the predefined boundaries of the Risk Appetite Framework.
