The Risk-Based Methodology provides a six-step process beginning with the Institutional Overview, which offers a comprehensive portrait of an AI's structure and risk issues. The Risk Assessment Exercise utilizes the Building-Block Approach to evaluate inherent risks and the effectiveness of risk management systems, culminating in the Risk Assessment Narrative that informs the AI's risk profile. These entities are interrelated to facilitate focused supervisory efforts on high-risk areas, enhancing regulatory compliance and risk management.\",\n  \"findings\": [\n    {\n      \"summary\": \"Risk-Based Methodology as the supervisory framework\",\n      \"explanation\": \"The Risk-Based Methodology is a structured six-step approach employed by the HKMA to supervise Authorized Institutions (AIs).
