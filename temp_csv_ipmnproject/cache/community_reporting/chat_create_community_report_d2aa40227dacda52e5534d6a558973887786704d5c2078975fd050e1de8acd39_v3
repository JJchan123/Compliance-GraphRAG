Key entities include the AI itself, the Board of Directors, Board-level Committees such as the Audit Committee, the Head of Compliance, the Compliance Function, Internal Audit Function, Business Units, and the Internal Control System. The relationships among these entities form a structured governance and supervisory framework that ensures adherence to regulatory standards and effective risk management. The Board and its designated committees oversee compliance policies and the appointment of the Head of Compliance, who leads the independent Compliance Function responsible for managing compliance risk. The Internal Audit Function provides independent assurance on the effectiveness of internal controls and risk management, including identifying deficiencies and non-compliance. Business Units act as the first line of defence managing risks operationally, while the three lines of defence model integrates these roles to optimize risk governance. External legal advice may be engaged under the oversight of the Compliance Function to supplement compliance tasks. This interconnected structure supports robust compliance with statutory and regulatory requirements, promoting the stability and integrity of the financial system.\",\n  \"findings\": [\n    {\n      \"summary\": \"Authorized Institutions (AIs) as the central regulated entities\",\n      \"explanation\": \"Authorized Institutions (AIs) are licensed banks or financial institutions regulated by the HKMA, forming the core of this community. They are responsible for establishing and maintaining comprehensive risk management frameworks, including firm-wide policies, internal controls, and risk reporting mechanisms. The Boards of AIs bear ultimate responsibility for overseeing these frameworks to manage various risks arising from their financial activities.

It may designate independent Board-level Committees, such as the Audit Committee, to review and approve compliance policies and monitor their implementation. These committees facilitate governance by overseeing compliance functions and coordinating with risk committees to ensure comprehensive risk oversight. The Board or its designated committee also approves the appointment of the Head of Compliance, ensuring independence and proper governance [Data: Entities (490, 77), Relationships (1075, 1297, 1073, 1276)].\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"summary\": \"The Head of Compliance leads an independent Compliance Function\",\n      \"explanation\": \"The Head of Compliance is a senior officer appointed by the Board or its designated committee to oversee the firmwide Compliance Function within an AI. This role requires independence from business units and sufficient authority and resources to effectively perform compliance duties. The Compliance Function operates as the second line of defence, responsible for ensuring adherence to statutory provisions, regulatory requirements, and internal policies, including anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing regulations. It provides compliance training, advises senior management, and monitors ongoing compliance, reporting directly to senior management or the Board.

Staff in these units identify, assess, manage, and report risks in alignment with the AI's risk appetite and policies, ensuring compliance with overall risk management objectives.
