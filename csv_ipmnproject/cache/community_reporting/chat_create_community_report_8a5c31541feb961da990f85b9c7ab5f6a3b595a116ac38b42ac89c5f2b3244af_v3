This system assesses various components, including capital adequacy, asset quality, management quality, earnings, and liquidity, which are essential for understanding an AI's overall soundness. The effectiveness of the risk management system is a significant factor in determining the CAMEL rating, highlighting the interconnectedness of risk management and compliance within the financial sector.
