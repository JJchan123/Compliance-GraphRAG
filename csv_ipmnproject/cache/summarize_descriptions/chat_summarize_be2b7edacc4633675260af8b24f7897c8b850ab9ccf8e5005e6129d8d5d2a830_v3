This system is essential for maintaining financial stability and ensuring compliance with regulatory standards, particularly under the supervision of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA). It includes a set of policies, procedures, and controls designed to measure and manage risks associated with financial products and services, thereby ensuring the safety and soundness of the institutions involved. The framework is critical for effective supervision and operational soundness, as it mandates that AIs hold adequate capital against identified risks and maintain a robust risk management environment.
