It is developed through a formalized risk assessment process that identifies, evaluates, and monitors significant risks faced by Authorized Institutions (AIs). This profile is crucial for understanding the risk exposure of AIs and ensuring compliance with regulatory standards. The relationship between the Risk Profile and the Risk Assessment Process highlights the importance of systematic evaluation in maintaining robust risk management practices.
