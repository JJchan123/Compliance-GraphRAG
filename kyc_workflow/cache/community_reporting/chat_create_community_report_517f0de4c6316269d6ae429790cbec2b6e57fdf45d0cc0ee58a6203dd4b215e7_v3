Key entities include various compliance policies and procedures such as Customer Due Diligence (CDD), Customer Address Verification, Watch Lists, Watch List Screening, Third Party Payment Approval, and Funds Repayment Policy. These entities are interconnected through their collective role in mitigating money laundering risks. The relationships highlight how AIs operationalize these policies to manage and reduce exposure to financial crime, with senior management oversight embedded in critical approval processes.

Each policy targets specific aspects of money laundering risk, collectively forming a robust compliance framework. For instance, CDD processes verify customer identities and assess risk levels, while address verification ensures accurate customer information. Watch lists and screening functions help detect transactions involving high-risk individuals such as terrorist suspects or politically exposed persons (PEPs). Third Party Payment Approval requires senior management oversight for payments to mitigate risks further.
