This approach incorporates the risk profiles and risk management ratings of Authorized Institutions directly into the CAMEL framework, enabling a more forward-looking and dynamic assessment of these entities. By embedding risk considerations into the CAMEL ratings, regulators can better anticipate potential vulnerabilities and tailor supervisory actions accordingly, thereby strengthening governance, risk management, and regulatory compliance within the financial sector.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 102, "prompt_tokens": 300, "total_tokens": 402, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
