This financial crime poses significant risks to financial institutions and is a primary target of Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Counter-Financing of Terrorism (CFT) frameworks. Authorized Institutions (AIs) play a critical role in preventing money laundering by implementing comprehensive customer acceptance policies, conducting customer due diligence (CDD), and applying enhanced due diligence measures, especially when dealing with politically exposed persons (PEPs). These institutions also monitor ownership and control structures to identify and mitigate risks. Supervisory guidelines emphasize the importance of these preventive measures to ensure effective governance, risk management, and compliance within the financial sector.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 151, "prompt_tokens": 473, "total_tokens": 624, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
