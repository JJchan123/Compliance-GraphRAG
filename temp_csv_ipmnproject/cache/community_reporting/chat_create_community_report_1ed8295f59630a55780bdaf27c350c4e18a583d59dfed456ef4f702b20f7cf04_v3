Key entities include the AIs themselves, their internal Business Units, the Three Lines of Defence risk governance model, the Internal Control System, and Supervisory Policies and Practices. Business Units act as the first line of defence managing risks within limits set by senior management. The Three Lines of Defence framework structures risk management responsibilities across Business Units, risk management and compliance functions, and internal audit. The Internal Control System underpins effective operations and compliance by establishing controls and safeguarding assets.

They are responsible for establishing and maintaining effective risk management systems, including firm-wide policies, internal controls, and risk reporting mechanisms. The Board of Directors and management oversee these frameworks to manage risks arising from financial activities and evolving market conditions.
