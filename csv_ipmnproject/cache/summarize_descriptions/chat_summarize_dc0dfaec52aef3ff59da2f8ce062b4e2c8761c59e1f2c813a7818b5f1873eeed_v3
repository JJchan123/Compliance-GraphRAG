This practice is a critical focus of the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT) efforts, particularly emphasized by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA). The provision of funds for terrorist activities can stem from both legal and illegal sources of income, representing a serious risk to the integrity of the financial system. Financial institutions must address these risks through robust AML/CFT systems to ensure compliance with regulatory standards and to mitigate potential threats to national and international security. Overall, terrorist financing poses substantial challenges that require vigilant oversight and proactive measures from financial entities to safeguard against its implications.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 156, "prompt_tokens": 447, "total_tokens": 603, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
