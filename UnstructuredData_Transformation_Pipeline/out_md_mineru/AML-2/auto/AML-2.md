This Guideline also:(a) provides a general background on the subjects of moneylaundering and terrorist financing (ML/TF), including a summary of the main provisions of the applicable AML/CFTlegislation in Hong Kong; and(b)provides practical guidance to assist AIs and their seniormanagement in designing and implementing their ownpolicies, procedures and controls in the relevant operationalareas, taking into consideration their special circumstances, soas to meet the relevant AML/CFT statutory and regulatoryrequirements.</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1></td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>1.5</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>The relevance and usefulness of this Guideline will be kept underreview and it may be necessary to issue amendments from time totime.</td></tr></table>

In addition to complying with this Guideline, RIs and associated entities that are AIs are required to have regard to the Guideline on Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Financing of Terrorism (For Licensed Corporations and SFClicensed Virtual Asset Service Providers) issued by the Securities and Futures Commission for requirements applicable to the securities, futures and leveraged foreign exchange businesses (e.g. definition of customer, provisions on cross-border correspondent relationships, illustrative indicators of suspicious transactions and activities in the securities sector, etc.), and Chapter 12 of the said Guideline for the provisions in relation to virtual assets.

Given thesignificant differences that exist in the organisational and legal structures of different AIs as well as the nature and scope of thebusiness activities conducted by them, there exists no single set ofuniversally applicable implementation measures. The content ofthis Guideline is not intended to be an exhaustive list of the meansof meeting the statutory and regulatory requirements. AIs shouldtherefore use this Guideline as a basis to develop measuresappropriate to their structure and business activities.</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">s.7, AMLO</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">1.7</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">This Guideline also provides guidance in relation to the operationof the provisions of Schedule 2 to the AMLO (Schedule 2). Thiswill assist AIs to meet their legal and regulatory obligations when tailored by AIs to their particular business risk profile. A failure by any person to comply with any provision of this Guideline does notby itself render the person liable to any judicial or other proceedingsbut, in any proceedings under the AMLO before any court, thisGuideline is admissible in evidence; and if any provision set out inthis Guideline appears to the court to be relevant to any questionarising in the proceedings, the provision must be taken into account in determining that question. In considering whether a person hascontravened a provision of Schedule 2, the HKMA must haveregard to any relevant provision in this Guideline.</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">1.8</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">A failure to comply with any provision of this Guideline may reflectadversely on whether an AI continues to comply with theauthorization criteria set out in the Seventh Schedule to the BO,particularly paragraph 10 of which requires an AI to maintain onand after authorization adequate accounting systems and systemsof control. TThe HKMA is empowered to exercise variousprovisions under the BO in case of non-compliance with therequirements set out in this Guideline.</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2" rowspan="1"> The nature of money laundering and terrorist financing</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"> The nature of money laundering and terrorist financing</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">s.1, Sch. 1, AMLO</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">1.9</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">The term "money laundering" (ML) is defined in section 1 of Part1 of Schedule 1 to the AMLO and means an act intended to have the effect of making any property:(a) that is the proceeds obtained from the commission of an indictable offence under the laws of Hong Kong, or of anyconduct which if it had occurred in Hong Kong wouldconstitute an indictable offence under the laws of Hong Kong;or(b) that in whole or in part, directly or indirectly, represents suchproceeds, not to appear to be or so represent such proceeds.</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">1.10</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">There are three common stages in the laundering of money, andthey frequently involve numerous transactions. An AI should bealert to any such sign for potential criminal activities. These stagesare:(a)Placement - the disposal of cash proceeds derived from illegalactivities into the financial system;(b)Layering - separating illicit proceeds from their source bycreating complex layers of financial transactions designed todisguise the source of the money, subvert the audit trail andprovide anonymity; and(c) Integration - creating the impression of apparent legitimacy tocriminally derived wealth. In situations where the layeringprocess succeeds, integration schemes effectively return thelaundered proceeds back into the general financial system andthe proceeds appear to be the result of, or connected to,legitimate business activities.</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">s.1, Sch. 1, AMLO</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">1.11</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">The term "terrorist financing" (TF) is defined in section 1 of Part 1of Schedule 1 to the AMLO and means:(a) the provision or collection, by any means, directly or indirectly, of any property(i) with the intention that the property be used; or(ii) knowing that the property will be used,in whole or in part, to commit one or more terrorist acts(whether or not the property is actually so used);(b) the making available of any property or financial (or related)services, by any means, directly or indirectly, to or for thebenefit of a person knowing that, or being reckless as towhether, the person is a terrorist or terrorist associate; or(c) the collection of property or solicitation of financial (or related) services, by any means, directly or indirectly, for the benefit ofa person knowing that, or being reckless as to whether, theperson is a terrorist or terrorist associate.</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">1.12</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Terrorists or terrorist organisations require financial support inorder to achieve their aims.

The objectives of the FATF are to setstandards and promote effective implementation of legal,regulatory and operational measures for combating of ML, TF, PF,and other related threats to the integrity of the internationalfYn nancial system.The FATF has developed a series ofRecommendations that are recognised as the international standardsfor combating of ML, TF and PF. They form the basis for a co-ordinated response to these threats to the integrity of the financial system and help ensure a level playing field. In order to ensure fulland effective implementation of its standards at the global level, theFATF monitors compliance by conducting evaluations on jurisdictions and undertakes stringent follow-up after theevaluations, including identifying high-risk and other monitored jurisdictions which could be subject to enhanced scrutiny by theFATF or counter-measures by the FATF members and theinternational community at large. Many major economies have joined the FATF which has developed into a global network forinternational cooperation that facilitates exchanges betweenmember jurisdictions. As a member of the FATF, Hong Kong isobliged to implement the latest FATF Recommendations2 and it is important that Hong Kong complies with the internationalAML/CFT standards in order to maintain its status as aninternational financial centre.</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">1.14</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">The main pieces of legislation in Hong Kong that are concernedwith ML, TF, PF and financial sanctions are the AMLO, the DrugTrafficking (Recovery of Proceeds) Ordinance (DTROP), theOrganized and Serious Crimes Ordinance (OSCO), the UnitedNations (Anti-Terrorism Measures) Ordinance (UNATMO), theUnited Nations Sanctions Ordinance (UNSO) and the Weapons ofMass Destruction (Control of Provision of Services) Ordinance(WMD(CPS)O).
