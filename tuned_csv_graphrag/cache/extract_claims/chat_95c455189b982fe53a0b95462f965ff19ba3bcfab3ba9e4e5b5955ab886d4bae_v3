The process follows a risk-based approach. It consists of a structured methodology designed to establish a forward-looking view on the risk profile of AIs. This permits a direct and specific focus on the areas of greatest risk to an AI. It also enables the HKMA to be more proactive and better positioned to pre-empt any serious threat to the stability of the banking system from any current or emerging risks.)\n##\n(HKMA<|>AIS<|>SUPERVISORY FRAMEWORK BENEFITS<|>TRUE<|>NONE<|>NONE<|>The HKMA’s risk-based supervisory framework provides key benefits including better evaluation of risks, early identification of emerging risks, cost-effective use of resources, increased use of management information from AIs, improved supervisor appreciation of AI management quality and business characteristics, and enhanced value of supervisory work.<|>The key benefits for both the HKMA and AIs from this riskbased supervisory framework are: better evaluation of risks through separate assessment of inherent risks and risk management processes; greater emphasis on early identification of emerging risks at individual AIs and on a sectorwide basis; cost-effective use of resources through a sharper focus on risks, which in time should result in examination teams spending less time on site at individual AIs; more utilisation by the HKMA of management information prepared by AIs; a better appreciation by supervisors of the management quality of AIs, the characteristics of their business and the risks they face; enhanced value of the supervisory work performed to both the management of AIs and the supervisors,)\n<|COMPLETE|>", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 444, "prompt_tokens": 1565, "total_tokens": 2009, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 1152, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
