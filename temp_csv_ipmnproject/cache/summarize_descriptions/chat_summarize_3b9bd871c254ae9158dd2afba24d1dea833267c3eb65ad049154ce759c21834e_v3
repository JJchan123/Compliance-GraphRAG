These risks include credit risk, market risk, interest rate risk, liquidity risk, operational risk, reputation risk, legal risk, strategic risk, and emerging risk. The level of inherent risk represents the probability and potential severity of loss arising from adverse events or actions within specific activities or products, evaluated independently of the effectiveness or quality of existing risk management systems. The HKMA assesses inherent risk qualitatively and quantitatively for each Authorized Institution (AI), categorizing it as high, moderate, or low based on factors such as the likelihood of occurrence, potential impact on the AI’s capital or earnings, and the evolving risk landscape over the next 12 months, including considerations for new products. This assessment reflects the risk profile of AIs and informs supervisory strategies to ensure robust risk management and regulatory compliance.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 196, "prompt_tokens": 626, "total_tokens": 822, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
