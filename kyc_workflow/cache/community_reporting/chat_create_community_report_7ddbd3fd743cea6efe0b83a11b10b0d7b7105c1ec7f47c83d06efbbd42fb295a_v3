Key entities include customers, financial crime compliance functions, and various verification processes such as source of funds verification, signature verification, and customer account opening documentation. The relationships highlight the critical role of AIs in conducting customer due diligence, transaction monitoring, and risk management to prevent money laundering and terrorist financing. The ecosystem also involves the use of utility bills, rates bills, and home visits as address verification methods, supported by guidelines that govern money laundering prevention practices.
