The risk governance framework should also outline escalation and notification procedures (including vertically to the Board and senior management) as well as potential disciplinary actions for excessive risk-taking by individuals. 2.1.3 It is generally expected that responsibilities among different functions of the AI are defined in such a way that there are three lines of defence which are independent from each other: the first line of defence is provided by the business units where risks are taken. In the course of conducting business activities, staff in the business units hold frontline positions in the proper identification, assessment, management and reporting of risk exposures on an ongoing basis, having regard to the AI’s risk appetite, policies, procedures and controls. The roles and responsibilities of risk owners in business units should be clearly defined; the second line of defence is provided by independent and effective risk management and compliance functions. The risk management function is primarily responsible for overseeing the AI’s risk-taking activities, undertaking risk assessments and reporting independently from the business line, while the compliance function monitors compliance with laws, corporate governance rules, regulations and internal policies; and the third line of defence is provided by an independent and effective internal audit function, which is responsible for providing assurance on the effectiveness of the AI’s risk management framework including the risk governance arrangements (including the first and second lines of defence described above).)\n\n(BOARD OF DIRECTORS<|>AI<|>RISK GOVERNANCE RESPONSIBILITIES<|>TRUE<|>NONE<|>NONE<|>The Board of Directors is responsible for establishing sound business strategy, monitoring adherence to risk appetite and risk limits, and overseeing risk governance arrangements within the AI.<|>2.1.1 Risk governance refers to the formal arrangements that enable the Board of Directors (the Board) and senior management of an AI to establish sound business strategy, articulate and monitor adherence to risk appetite and risk limits, and identify, measure, manage and control risks.)\n\n(SENIOR MANAGEMENT<|>AI<|>RISK GOVERNANCE RESPONSIBILITIES<|>TRUE<|>NONE<|>NONE<|>Senior management of the AI shares responsibility with the Board of Directors in establishing business strategy, monitoring risk appetite and limits, and managing risk governance.<|>2.1.1 Risk governance refers to the formal arrangements that enable the Board of Directors (the Board) and senior management of an AI to establish sound business strategy, articulate and monitor adherence to risk appetite and risk limits, and identify, measure, manage and control risks.)\n\n(BUSINESS UNITS<|>AI<|>RISK MANAGEMENT FUNCTION<|>TRUE<|>NONE<|>NONE<|>Business units provide the first line of defence by taking risks and holding frontline positions in identifying, assessing, managing, and reporting risk exposures in accordance with the AI’s risk appetite, policies, procedures, and controls.<|>2.1.3 It is generally expected that responsibilities among different functions of the AI are defined in such a way that there are three lines of defence which are independent from each other: the first line of defence is provided by the business units where risks are taken.
