These deficiencies indicate non-compliance with AML/CFT regulatory requirements set by authorities such as the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) and the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC). Such shortcomings necessitate remedial actions, including independent reviews, investigations, and supervisory follow-ups, to rectify the failures and strengthen the institutions’ AML/CFT systems. Addressing these deficiencies is critical to ensuring that the institutions meet regulatory standards and maintain effective controls to prevent money laundering and terrorism financing risks. Failure to do so may result in supervisory or disciplinary measures imposed by the relevant regulatory bodies.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 157, "prompt_tokens": 338, "total_tokens": 495, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
