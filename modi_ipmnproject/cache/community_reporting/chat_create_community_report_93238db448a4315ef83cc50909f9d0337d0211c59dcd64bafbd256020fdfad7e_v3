These risks are essential for assessing the supervisory processes of Authorized Institutions (AIs). Understanding these inherent risks allows financial institutions to develop effective risk management strategies, ensuring compliance with regulatory standards and enhancing overall financial stability. The HKMA emphasizes the evaluation of these risks to maintain a resilient financial sector.

This risk is particularly pronounced in fluctuating market conditions and is a fundamental component of the CAMEL rating system. Effective management of credit risk is crucial for maintaining compliance and financial stability, necessitating robust monitoring and reporting practices. The relationship between credit risk and the risk management system is vital for AIs to navigate the complexities of lending and ensure adherence to regulatory standards.

This system evaluates various risk management ratings, providing a comprehensive overview of an institution's operational health. By incorporating the CAMEL rating into the risk-based supervisory approach, the HKMA ensures that AIs maintain robust compliance and effective risk management practices, ultimately contributing to the stability of the financial system.
