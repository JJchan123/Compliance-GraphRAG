The Risk Committee operates as a stand-alone committee, separate from the Board’s Audit Committee, which ensures a clear separation between risk oversight and audit functions. Despite their distinct mandates, both committees maintain appropriate arrangements, including periodic meetings, to facilitate effective information exchange and joint oversight of risk management. This collaborative approach enhances the organization’s ability to identify, assess, and manage risks comprehensively while preserving the independence and focus of each committee’s responsibilities.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 116, "prompt_tokens": 300, "total_tokens": 416, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
