The HKMA is responsible for ensuring that these institutions comply with established AML/CFT regulations, thereby safeguarding the integrity of the financial system.\n\nTo facilitate learning and capacity building in AML/CFT, the HKMA actively shares supervisory feedback with AIs and conducts meetings with them. This collaborative approach aims to enhance the understanding and implementation of effective AML/CFT systems within these institutions. The HKMA's supervisory activities are designed to ensure that AIs not only comply with regulations but also address any deficiencies in their AML/CFT frameworks.\n\nIn addition to compliance oversight, the HKMA assesses the overall safety and soundness of AIs, ensuring that they operate within a secure and stable environment. This comprehensive supervision helps to mitigate risks associated with money laundering and terrorist financing, reinforcing the resilience of Hong Kong's financial sector.\n\nOverall, the HKMA's multifaceted approach to supervision and capacity building underscores its commitment to maintaining robust AML/CFT practices among Authorized Institutions in Hong Kong.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 246, "prompt_tokens": 247, "total_tokens": 493, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
