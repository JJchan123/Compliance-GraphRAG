This technique is particularly valuable in the field of risk management, where it helps to identify and evaluate the potential impacts of changes in input variables on outcomes. By systematically altering the independent variable, sensitivity analysis provides insights into the robustness of a model and highlights which variables have the most significant effect on the dependent variable. This approach is essential for decision-making processes, allowing analysts and stakeholders to understand the range of possible outcomes and the associated risks.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 117, "prompt_tokens": 233, "total_tokens": 350, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
