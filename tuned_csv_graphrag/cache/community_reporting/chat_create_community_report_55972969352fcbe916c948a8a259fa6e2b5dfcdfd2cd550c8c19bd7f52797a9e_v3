Liquidity risk is a critical inherent risk faced by AIs, encompassing two primary subtypes: funding liquidity risk and market liquidity risk. Funding liquidity risk involves the AI's inability to liquidate assets or secure funding, while market liquidity risk pertains to challenges in unwinding positions without significant losses due to market conditions. The relationships highlight that AIs are directly exposed to both subtypes, emphasizing the importance of robust risk management procedures and risk limits to ensure financial obligations are met without unacceptable losses.\",\n  \"findings\": [\n    {\n      \"summary\": \"Liquidity risk is a fundamental inherent risk for Authorized Institutions under HKMA supervision\",\n      \"explanation\": \"Liquidity risk is explicitly identified by the HKMA as one of the eight inherent risks that Authorized Institutions must manage. It represents the risk that an AI will fail to meet its financial obligations as they come due without incurring unacceptable losses. This foundational risk category underpins the need for comprehensive governance and risk management frameworks within AIs to ensure ongoing financial stability and regulatory compliance [Data: Entities (23)].\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"summary\": \"Liquidity risk comprises two distinct but related components: funding liquidity risk and market liquidity risk\",\n      \"explanation\": \"The liquidity risk faced by AIs is subdivided into funding liquidity risk and market liquidity risk. Funding liquidity risk refers to the AI's inability to liquidate assets or obtain necessary funding to meet obligations. Market liquidity risk involves the difficulty in unwinding or offsetting positions without significantly depressing market prices, often due to insufficient market depth or disruptions. Understanding these components separately allows for targeted risk management strategies addressing both funding sources and market conditions [Data: Entities (23, 320, 321); Relationships (657)].\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"summary\": \"Authorized Institutions are directly exposed to both funding liquidity risk and market liquidity risk\",\n      \"explanation\": \"The relationships indicate that Authorized Institutions face exposure to both funding liquidity risk and market liquidity risk as integral parts of their overall liquidity risk profile.
