Key elements of an effective risk management framework 2.1 Risk governance 2.2 Risk appetite framework 2.1.1 Risk governance refers to the formal arrangements that enable the Board of Directors (the Board) and senior management of an AI to establish sound business strategy, articulate and monitor adherence to risk appetite and risk limits, and identify, measure, manage and control risks. 2.1.2 To ensure effective risk management, an AI should have in place a set of robust risk governance arrangements, whereby responsibilities of the Board and senior management, and among different functions of the AI (and the respective risk owners), are well defined. The risk governance framework should also outline escalation and notification procedures (including vertically to the Board and senior management) as well as potential disciplinary actions for excessive risk-taking by individuals. 2.1.3 It is generally expected that responsibilities among different functions of the AI are defined in such a way that there are three lines of defence which are independent from each other: the first line of defence is provided by the business units where risks are taken. In the course of conducting business activities, staff in the business units hold frontline positions in the proper identification, assessment, management and reporting of risk exposures on an ongoing basis, having regard to the AI’s risk appetite, policies, procedures and controls. The roles and responsibilities of risk owners in business units should be clearly defined; the second line of defence is provided by independent and effective risk management and compliance functions. The risk management function is primarily responsible for overseeing the AI’s risk-taking activities, undertaking risk assessments and reporting independently from the business line, while the compliance function monitors compliance with laws, corporate governance rules, regulations and internal policies; and the third line of defence is provided by an independent and effective internal audit function, which is responsible for providing assurance on the effectiveness of the AI’s risk management framework including the risk governance arrangements (including the first and second lines of defence described above).)\n<|COMPLETE|>", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 551, "prompt_tokens": 1576, "total_tokens": 2127, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 1024, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
