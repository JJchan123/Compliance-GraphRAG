Key entities include the AIs themselves, their Board Designated Committees responsible for overseeing risk management policies, risk measurement methods or models used to quantify risks, and supervisory processes such as back-testing to validate these models. The relationships highlight a structured flow where AIs make risk decisions informed by quantitative models and qualitative expert judgment, with oversight from Board Designated Committees that review risk measurement tools and ensure adherence to risk management policies. Regular back-testing processes are conducted by AIs to verify model accuracy, ensuring robust risk controls and compliance with regulatory expectations.\",\n  \"findings\": [\n    {\n      \"summary\": \"Authorized Institutions integrate quantitative and qualitative inputs in risk decision-making\",\n      \"explanation\": \"Authorized Institutions (AIs) employ a risk decision-making process that combines outputs from quantitative risk measurement models with qualitative expert judgment. This dual approach acknowledges the limitations of purely quantitative methods and incorporates practical insights, enabling more comprehensive risk assessments. Such integration supports informed decision-making aligned with the institution's risk appetite and regulatory requirements [Data: Entities (355); Relationships (766)].\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"summary\": \"Board Designated Committees play a critical oversight role in risk management\",\n      \"explanation\": \"Board Designated Committees are established by the Boards of Directors within AIs to oversee risk management activities. Their responsibilities include reviewing and assessing the assumptions, data sources, and procedures underlying risk measurement methods or models. This oversight ensures that risk models are appropriate, adequate, and aligned with the institution's risk profile and regulatory standards. The committees also assist in monitoring adherence to the overall risk management policy, reinforcing governance effectiveness [Data: Entities (354); Relationships (777, 771)].\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"summary\": \"Risk measurement methods or models are central tools subject to rigorous evaluation\",\n      \"explanation\": \"Risk measurement methods or models are essential tools adopted by AIs to quantify various types of risks. These models must consider the nature, scale, and complexity of the AI's business, as well as assumptions and data availability.

Authorized Institutions conduct back-testing as part of their supervisory and internal control processes. This practice helps identify model weaknesses or inaccuracies, prompting timely updates or adjustments. Back-testing thus serves as a critical feedback mechanism to maintain robust risk measurement and compliance with regulatory expectations [Data: Entities (353); Relationships (765)].\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"summary\": \"Structured relationships among entities support effective risk governance\",\n      \"explanation\": \"The community's entities and their relationships form a structured ecosystem where AIs implement risk management frameworks supported by governance bodies and supervisory processes.
