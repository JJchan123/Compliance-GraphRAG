It refers to the potential adverse impact of changes in interest rates on the value of financial instruments held by AIs, which can affect their earnings, financial condition, and overall risk profile. This risk encompasses various dimensions, including repricing risk, basis risk, options risk, and yield curve risk, as well as the influence of funding and broader business strategies. To manage interest rate risk, AIs employ sensitivity analysis, stress-testing, and established risk limits as part of their risk management processes. The HKMA closely monitors this risk to ensure that AIs maintain financial stability and resilience against fluctuations in interest rates that could negatively affect the value of their assets, liabilities, income, or capital position.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 177, "prompt_tokens": 741, "total_tokens": 918, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
