It employs a risk-based supervisory approach to monitor and assess the safety and soundness of AIs on a continuing basis, focusing on identifying and managing various inherent risks and ensuring effective risk management systems are in place.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AUTHORIZED INSTITUTION<|>AUTHORIZED INSTITUTION<|>Authorized Institutions (AIs) are financial institutions licensed and regulated by the HKMA. They are subject to ongoing supervision and risk assessment to ensure their safety and soundness, with their risk profiles evaluated across multiple inherent risk types and the adequacy of their risk management systems.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RISK ASSESSMENT PROCESS<|>SUPERVISORY PROCESS<|>The risk assessment process is a formal procedure developed by the HKMA to identify the type, level, and direction of all significant risks of an AI. It evaluates the level of inherent risk for each business activity, the adequacy of risk management systems, and the impact of external risk factors, culminating in a composite risk profile for the AI.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>INHERENT RISK<|>RISK TYPE<|>Inherent risk is defined as the probability and degree of potential loss due to an adverse event or action within a particular activity or product, without regard to the adequacy and quality of the relevant risk management system in place. It is assessed by weighing various factors and evaluation criteria specific to each risk type.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BOARD AND SENIOR MANAGEMENT OVERSIGHT<|>BOARD OF DIRECTORS<|>Active oversight by the board of directors and senior management is a critical element of a sound risk management system. This oversight ensures effective governance and control over risk exposures within the AI.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RISK MANAGEMENT POLICY<|>RISK MANAGEMENT POLICY<|>Organizational policies, procedures, and limits are established to manage business activities and control risk exposures. These policies form part of the effective risk management system overseen by the board and senior management.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RISK MEASUREMENT, MONITORING AND MANAGEMENT REPORTING SYSTEMS<|>RISK GOVERNANCE<|>Systems for risk measurement, monitoring, and management reporting provide essential information to assess risk exposures and support decision-making within the AI’s risk governance framework.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>INTERNAL AUDIT FUNCTION<|>INTERNAL AUDIT FUNCTION<|>The internal audit function provides comprehensive internal controls and independent assurance on the effectiveness of risk management systems and controls within the AI, forming a key component of the sound risk management system.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EIGHT INHERENT RISKS<|>RISK TYPE<|>The HKMA has identified eight inherent risks to be assessed during the risk assessment process: credit risk, market risk, interest rate risk, liquidity risk, operational risk, legal risk, reputation risk, and strategic risk. These risks represent potential sources of loss or adverse impact on the AI.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NEW RISK TYPES<|>RISK TYPE<|>New risk types may emerge over time and can have implications for one or more of the eight inherent risks identified by the HKMA. These emerging risks should be considered within the assessment of the established inherent risks.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HKMA<|>RISK ASSESSMENT PROCESS<|>The HKMA develops and implements the risk assessment process as part of its supervisory framework to evaluate the risk profiles of authorized institutions.<|>10)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>RISK ASSESSMENT PROCESS<|>AUTHORIZED INSTITUTION<|>The risk assessment process is applied to authorized institutions to identify and evaluate the types, levels, and directions of risks they face.<|>10)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>RISK ASSESSMENT PROCESS<|>INHERENT RISK<|>The risk assessment process evaluates the level of inherent risk for each business activity of an authorized institution.<|>10)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BOARD AND SENIOR MANAGEMENT OVERSIGHT<|>RISK MANAGEMENT POLICY<|>The board of directors and senior management provide active oversight to ensure the implementation and effectiveness of risk management policies, procedures, and limits.<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>RISK MANAGEMENT POLICY<|>RISK MEASUREMENT, MONITORING AND MANAGEMENT REPORTING SYSTEMS<|>Risk management policies and procedures guide the establishment and operation of risk measurement, monitoring, and reporting systems within the AI.<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>RISK MEASUREMENT, MONITORING AND MANAGEMENT REPORTING SYSTEMS<|>INTERNAL AUDIT FUNCTION<|>The internal audit function provides independent assurance on the effectiveness of risk measurement, monitoring, and reporting systems as part of the AI’s risk governance.<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>EIGHT INHERENT RISKS<|>AUTHORIZED INSTITUTION<|>The eight inherent risks are the key risk types assessed in authorized institutions during the risk assessment process.<|>10)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NEW RISK TYPES<|>EIGHT INHERENT RISKS<|>Emerging new risk types are considered in the assessment of the eight inherent risks, as they may impact one or more of these established risk categories.<|>8)\n<|COMPLETE|>", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 1139, "prompt_tokens": 6206, "total_tokens": 7345, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 5248, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
