These measures are proportionate and aimed at addressing serious deficiencies, deterring abuse of the banking system, and reinforcing compliance and effective risk management within financial institutions.\n\nThe enforcement toolkit available to the HKMA includes administrative and prudential actions such as issuing letters, statements of caution, compliance advice, and requiring remedial action plans along with status reports to rectify AML/CFT shortcomings. More formal disciplinary measures encompass remedial orders, pecuniary penalties, public reprimands, and prosecution of offenses. Prosecutions for contraventions of specified provisions under the AMLO are conducted by the Secretary for Justice and prosecuting authorities following supervisory findings by the HKMA.\n\nThroughout the enforcement process, the HKMA considers the level of cooperation from the parties involved, ensuring that sanctions or penalties are fair and effective in promoting adherence to regulatory standards and safeguarding the integrity of the banking system.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 252, "prompt_tokens": 565, "total_tokens": 817, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
