It encompasses both current and forward-looking perspectives on risk, providing a holistic view of potential vulnerabilities and threats. This profile serves as a crucial tool for understanding the inherent risks involved, particularly in the context of artificial intelligence (AI). \n\nDeveloped through a systematic risk assessment process, the risk profile captures all types of inherent risks associated with AI, ensuring that stakeholders are aware of the potential challenges and uncertainties that may arise. By integrating both qualitative and quantitative analyses, the risk profile aids in identifying, evaluating, and prioritizing risks, thereby facilitating informed decision-making and strategic planning.\n\nIn summary, the risk profile is an essential framework for comprehensively understanding and managing risks, particularly in complex environments such as those involving AI technologies.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 168, "prompt_tokens": 193, "total_tokens": 361, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
