Supervisory framework. version: V.2-23.12.2022. inherent risk could reasonably be expected to result in a loss, which could be absorbed by the AI in the normal course of business and low inherent risk could reasonably be expected to result in little or no loss to the AI. In assessing inherent risk, the direction of risk in the next 12 months, including the risk in any new products, must also be considered. 1.5.10 The second step is to evaluate by functional activity the risk management systems in place to manage the inherent risks. The risk management systems will be assessed as \"strong\", \"acceptable\" or \"weak\" in the areas of management oversight, policies and procedures, risk measurement and internal controls, as mentioned earlier. 1.5.11 The third step in phase three is to classify the composite risk profile for each of the significant business activities as \"low\", \"moderate\" or \"high\". This is a summary judgement arrived at by balancing the level of inherent risks of the business activity, the adequacy of the risk management systems for the activity and the direction of risk. 1.5.12 The direction of risk is required so that the assessment of risk reflects a forward as well as current view of the composite risk profile of an AI for a particular activity. For this purpose, the direction of risk is classified as “increasing”, “stable” or “decreasing”. 1.5.13 This means, for example, that if credit risk is the most significant risk for a particular activity conducted by an AI and it is increasing, that may prompt the HKMA to increase the composite risk profile for the activity in question (i.e. from “moderate” to “high”). If, however, the direction of credit risk is either stable or declining, it may not alter the composite risk profile for the activity concerned. 1.5.14 Since, however, the risk assessment process includes many judgemental considerations, it is also possible for the composite risk profile for an activity to be lowered under the same)\n<|COMPLETE|>", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 570, "prompt_tokens": 1572, "total_tokens": 2142, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 1152, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
