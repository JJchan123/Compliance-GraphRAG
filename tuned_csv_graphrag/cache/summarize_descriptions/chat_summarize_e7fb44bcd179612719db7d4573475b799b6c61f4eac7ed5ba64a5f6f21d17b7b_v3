It establishes and approves the AI’s overall business strategy, risk appetite framework, and risk limits, ensuring alignment with the institution’s strategic, business, capital, and financial plans. The Board actively oversees firm-wide risk governance by approving key risk management policies, procedures, and the new product approval policy, while delegating detailed operational responsibilities to senior management or designated committees such as the Risk Committee and Audit Committee.\n\nThe Board holds ultimate accountability for maintaining effective risk management systems, including the identification, measurement, evaluation, monitoring, reporting, and control or mitigation of all material risks across business lines. It ensures that risk-taking activities remain within approved limits, even under stressed conditions, and promotes a strong risk culture through transparent communication and challenge mechanisms between the Board, senior management, and staff. The Board also ensures the independence, competence, and adequate resourcing of risk management, compliance, and internal control functions, including the appointment of key personnel such as the Chief Risk Officer and Head of Compliance.\n\nIn fulfilling its oversight role, the Board receives timely, accurate, and sufficient risk reports, including stress testing and scenario analysis results, risk exposure assessments, and internal audit findings. It reviews and challenges risk measurement methodologies, assumptions, and data adequacy to ensure robust risk governance. The Board is responsible for addressing material risk management deficiencies and compliance weaknesses, including those related to anti-money laundering and counter-financing of terrorism (AML/CFT) systems, as highlighted by supervisory authorities such as the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA).\n\nFurthermore, the Board participates in regular supervisory engagements with regulators, particularly for locally incorporated banks, to discuss risk profiles, supervisory concerns, and remedial actions. It ensures that remuneration systems do not incentivize imprudent or excessive risk-taking and that risk appetite statements are consistently applied across the institution. Overall, the Board of Directors provides strong leadership and active oversight to sustain a disciplined risk appetite, effective governance, and sound risk management practices within the Authorized Institution.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 427, "prompt_tokens": 2498, "total_tokens": 2925, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
