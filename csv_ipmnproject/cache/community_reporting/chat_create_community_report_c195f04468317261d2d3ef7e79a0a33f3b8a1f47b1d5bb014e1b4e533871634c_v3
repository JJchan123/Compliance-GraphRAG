It encompasses various components such as contingency planning and business continuity planning, which are essential for maintaining operations during disruptions. The effectiveness of these systems is evaluated through internal audits, which assess their compliance with operational standards. This interconnectedness highlights the critical role of internal controls in risk management and regulatory adherence.

This systematic approach allows organizations to develop risk management functions that can effectively respond to crises, thereby safeguarding essential operations. The integration of contingency planning within the internal control framework enhances the resilience of AIs, making it a key focus area for compliance and risk management strategies.

This planning involves identifying critical functions and establishing protocols to sustain them in emergencies. By incorporating business continuity planning into their internal controls, AIs can mitigate risks associated with operational failures, thereby enhancing their compliance posture and overall stability.
