This expectation can lead to overly stringent compliance measures that inadvertently exclude legitimate customers from accessing essential banking services. As a result, individuals and businesses that do not fit the narrow risk profiles defined by banks may find themselves unable to open accounts or obtain loans, exacerbating financial exclusion.

When people are unable to access basic banking services, they are often forced to rely on alternative financial services, which can be more expensive and less secure. This exclusion can perpetuate cycles of poverty and limit economic opportunities, making it crucial for regulators to consider the balance between compliance and accessibility.

Regulators and financial institutions must work together to develop compliance frameworks that effectively mitigate risks without unnecessarily restricting access to banking services.

By understanding the dynamics between the zero failure regime and financial exclusion, regulators can create policies that encourage financial institutions to adopt more flexible compliance practices. This could help ensure that all individuals and businesses have access to necessary banking services while still addressing the risks of money laundering and terrorist financing.
