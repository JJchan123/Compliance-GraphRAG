It involves a comprehensive set of procedures to verify the identity of customers and beneficial owners, including individuals such as directors, principal shareholders, settlors, asset contributors, protectors, and beneficiaries. This verification often requires official identity documents, such as passports and other travel documents, especially for corporate customers with complex, multi-layer ownership structures. The CDD process also entails understanding the purpose and intended nature of the business relationship, assessing associated risks and materiality related to money laundering and terrorist financing, and maintaining thorough documentation. Furthermore, it includes ongoing monitoring and scrutiny of transactions to ensure they remain consistent with the customer’s risk profile, thereby enabling effective governance, risk management, and regulatory compliance within financial organizations.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 180, "prompt_tokens": 501, "total_tokens": 681, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
