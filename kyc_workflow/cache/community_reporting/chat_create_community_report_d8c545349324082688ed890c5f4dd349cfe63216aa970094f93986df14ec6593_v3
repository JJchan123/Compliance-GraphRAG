Key entities include the Authorized Institutions themselves, the ordering institutions acting as originators of wire transfers, and the originators who initiate these transfers. The relationships emphasize the regulatory obligations of AIs to verify and record originator identities to mitigate risks of financial crime such as money laundering and terrorist financing. Wire transfers are highlighted as critical points requiring stringent AML/CFT controls, with specific thresholds (e.g., HK$8,000) triggering enhanced due diligence processes. This ecosystem reflects the interconnected roles and responsibilities essential for effective governance, risk management, and supervisory oversight within Hong Kong's banking sector.\",\n  \"findings\": [\n    {\n      \"summary\": \"Authorized Institutions' central role in compliance\",\n      \"explanation\": \"Authorized Institutions (AIs) are the primary entities responsible for implementing customer due diligence (CDD) requirements in wire transfer and currency exchange transactions. They must record and verify the identities of customers involved in these transactions to comply with AML/CFT regulations. This central role positions AIs as critical nodes in the financial compliance ecosystem, ensuring that transactions are monitored and risks of financial crime are mitigated effectively.
