Supervisory attention and resources of the HKMA are focused on AIs that are subject to higher ML/TF risks, while maintaining adequate and appropriate levels of engagement with AIs that present lower ML/TF risks.

At the most serious end of the scale, where there is sufficient evidence to establish that an offence under section 5 of the AMLO has been committed by the AI concerned and/or an employee, and it is in the public interest to do so, the HKMA may prosecute the offence under section 79 of the AMLO. In less serious cases, where AIs are not fully compliant but the impact of the deficiencies on risk management is less serious, compliance advice letters may be issued to AIs as an enforcement tool to bring the areas of weakness to the attention of management and/or board of directors so that they can be properly addressed. Repeat failures and failures to act on compliance advice are likely to raise more serious concerns about management and the adequacy of controls and may result in disciplinary or other actions. ",
