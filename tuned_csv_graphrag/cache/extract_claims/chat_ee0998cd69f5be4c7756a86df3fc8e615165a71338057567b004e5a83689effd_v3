Frequency, timeliness, contents, granularity, distribution and level of confidentiality of risk management reports should be appropriate for the needs of recipients. While individual AIs should determine risk reporting requirements that are appropriate for their own business models and risk profiles, at a minimum, the reports should cover all material risk areas (e.g. credit, market, interest rate, liquidity, operational, reputation, legal and strategic risks) and provide information in respect of risk concentrations, adherence to risk appetite and risk limits and forwardlooking assessment of risks. In addition, the risk management reports should provide information relating to regulatory ratios (e.g. capital adequacy ratios and liquidity ratios) and their projections.)\n\n<|COMPLETE|>", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 547, "prompt_tokens": 1575, "total_tokens": 2122, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 1152, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
