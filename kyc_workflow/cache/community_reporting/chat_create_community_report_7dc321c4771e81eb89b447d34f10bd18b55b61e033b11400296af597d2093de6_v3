Central to this ecosystem are the Authorized Institutions themselves, which apply Extra Care Measures to mitigate risks associated with high-risk customers or jurisdictions. Intermediaries play a critical role by conducting Customer Due Diligence Procedures with rigor equivalent to that of AIs. The identification and management of Beneficial Owners, including those represented by Nominee Shareholders, are pivotal for transparency and risk mitigation. Declarations from Beneficial Owners regarding shareholding percentages are formalized and updated regularly to maintain oversight integrity. The relationships among these entities form a comprehensive framework that supports effective governance, risk management, and regulatory compliance within the banking sector.\",\n  \"findings\": [\n    {\n      \"summary\": \"Authorized Institutions implement Extra Care Measures to mitigate AML/CFT risks.\",\n      \"explanation\": \"Authorized Institutions (AIs) are responsible for applying enhanced due diligence procedures known as Extra Care Measures when dealing with customers or beneficial owners linked to jurisdictions that inadequately apply the FATF Recommendations. These measures represent supervisory actions designed to address elevated risks in AML/CFT contexts, ensuring that high-risk exposures are managed with greater scrutiny and control. The implementation of these measures reflects the AIs' proactive role in risk mitigation within the regulatory framework established by the HKMA [Data: Entities (168), Relationships (265)].\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"summary\": \"Intermediaries must perform Customer Due Diligence Procedures with rigor equivalent to Authorized Institutions.\",\n      \"explanation\": \"Intermediaries, which act as agents or facilitators in financial transactions, are mandated to conduct Customer Due Diligence Procedures that match the rigor of those performed by Authorized Institutions. This requirement ensures consistency and thoroughness in verifying customer identities and assessing associated risks across the financial ecosystem. By holding intermediaries to this standard, the supervisory framework extends robust risk management practices beyond AIs to all relevant actors involved in customer onboarding and transaction processing [Data: Entities (183), Relationships (276)].\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"summary\": \"Nominee Shareholders require special care in Customer Due Diligence to ensure transparency.\",\n      \"explanation\": \"Nominee Shareholders, who hold shares on behalf of beneficial owners, introduce complexity and potential opacity in ownership structures.

Their identification is fundamental to AML/CFT risk assessments, particularly when linked to jurisdictions with insufficient FATF compliance.
