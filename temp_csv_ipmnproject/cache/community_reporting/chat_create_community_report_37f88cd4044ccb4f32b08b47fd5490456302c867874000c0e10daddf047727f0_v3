The framework is designed to identify, assess, and manage money laundering (ML) and terrorist financing (TF) risks across various banking segments, including private banking, trade finance, international fund transfers, and retail and corporate banking. Thematic examinations are a key supervisory tool targeting specific high-risk areas to ensure robust compliance.

This approach targets vulnerabilities in various banking segments and ensures compliance with regulatory standards, thereby strengthening the financial system's resilience.
