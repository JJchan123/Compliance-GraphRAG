It defines the amount and nature of risk that the organization is prepared to tolerate, shaping key aspects such as remuneration incentives and risk governance frameworks. To ensure alignment with the institution’s overall business strategies, risk appetite is typically formalized through the setting of risk limits, which are integrated into the annual budget approval process overseen by the Board.
