Listed Companies are corporate customers whose shares are traded on Recognised Stock Exchanges, which are officially regulated marketplaces operating under compliance frameworks aligned with FATF standards. Subsidiary Companies are controlled by Listed Companies and require identity and beneficial ownership verification by Authorized Institutions (AIs). The Recognised Stock Exchanges are defined and regulated by the SFO and must comply with FATF recommendations, ensuring robust AML/CFT controls. These relationships establish a layered compliance and supervisory ecosystem where AIs implement customer due diligence and risk management frameworks based on these regulatory definitions and controls.\",\n  \"findings\": [\n    {\n      \"summary\": \"Listed Companies as central corporate customers with verified identities\",\n      \"explanation\": \"Listed Companies represent corporate customers whose shares are publicly traded on Recognised Stock Exchanges.
