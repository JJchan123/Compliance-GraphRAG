This risk management technique involves simulating various stress scenarios to evaluate the potential impact on financial stability and the institution's overall financial position. By conducting these simulations, AIs can validate the effectiveness of their risk management models and ensure preparedness for extreme financial conditions. Stress testing is a critical component of risk management processes, enabling organizations to determine their ability to withstand economic shocks and assess the robustness of their risk management systems.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 113, "prompt_tokens": 370, "total_tokens": 483, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
