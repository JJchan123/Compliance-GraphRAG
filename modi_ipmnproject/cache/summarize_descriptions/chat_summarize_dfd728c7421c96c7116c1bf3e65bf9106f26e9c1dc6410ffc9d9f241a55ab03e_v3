This methodology integrates the risk profile of AIs into the CAMEL rating system, emphasizing areas of greatest risk to ensure effective supervision. Specifically, it focuses on the risks associated with money laundering and terrorist financing (ML/TF), tailoring supervisory engagement to be proportional to the level of risk presented by different segments of the banking sector and individual AIs. By prioritizing compliance and stability, RISK-BASED SUPERVISION aims to enhance the overall integrity of the financial system while addressing the most pressing risks.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 146, "prompt_tokens": 347, "total_tokens": 493, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
