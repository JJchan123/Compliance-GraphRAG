It mandates that Authorized Institutions maintain adequate accounting systems and robust internal controls to ensure prudent business conduct, safeguard assets, minimize fraud risks, monitor overall risk exposure, and comply with all applicable legal and regulatory requirements. Under the BO, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) is granted statutory authority to supervise and enforce regulatory compliance among Authorized Institutions, including the issuance of Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT) guidelines. The Ordinance also empowers the HKMA with enforcement capabilities, such as those outlined in section 59(2), which pertains to the validation of remedial actions taken by institutions. Overall, the Banking Ordinance establishes a comprehensive regulatory framework to promote sound governance, risk management, and financial integrity within Hong Kong’s banking sector.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 182, "prompt_tokens": 406, "total_tokens": 588, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
