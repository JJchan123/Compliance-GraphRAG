Senior Management is tasked with the implementation of risk management strategies as directed by the Board. This relationship underscores the accountability of Senior Management to the Board, ensuring that the strategies align with the organization's objectives and risk appetite.\n\nThe Board, in turn, has a supervisory role, overseeing the actions and reports provided by Senior Management concerning risk management and internal controls. This collaborative effort between the Board and Senior Management is essential for effective risk management within the organization, particularly in the context of artificial intelligence (AI) initiatives. By working together, they ensure that risks are identified, assessed, and managed appropriately, fostering a culture of accountability and transparency.\n\nIn summary, the dynamic between Senior Management and the Board is characterized by a clear delineation of responsibilities, with Senior Management executing the risk management strategies and the Board providing oversight and guidance.
