This adherence is crucial for ensuring effective governance and risk management within the financial sector. Specifically, AIs must comply with laws and regulations related to Anti-Money Laundering and Counter Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT), implementing robust systems and controls to mitigate risks. Compliance is evaluated through the supervisory process conducted by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) and other regulatory bodies, which assess the institutions' alignment with sound banking practices and internal policies. This adherence is not only a critical aspect of the HKMA's supervisory assessments but also ensures that AIs operate within the legal and regulatory frameworks necessary for maintaining operational integrity and effectiveness.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 163, "prompt_tokens": 416, "total_tokens": 579, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
