It evaluates multiple critical dimensions including an AI’s financial condition, compliance with laws and regulations, risk management systems, and overall operating soundness. A key feature of the CAMEL system is its incorporation of risk-based supervisory elements, particularly risk management ratings derived from on-site, risk-focused examinations. These risk management ratings are integrated into the management component of the CAMEL rating and can influence the composite rating assigned to an institution. The CAMEL rating system enables the HKMA to identify AIs that require special supervisory attention or heightened regulatory concern, thereby supporting effective governance, risk management, and regulatory compliance within the financial sector in Hong Kong.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 164, "prompt_tokens": 599, "total_tokens": 763, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
