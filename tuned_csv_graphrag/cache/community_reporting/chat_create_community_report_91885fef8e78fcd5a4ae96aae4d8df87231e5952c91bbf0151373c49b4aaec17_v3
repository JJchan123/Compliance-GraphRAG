The RAF is formally established and approved by the Board of Directors and senior management, defining the types and levels of risk the AI is willing to accept to meet strategic objectives. It integrates quantitative limits and qualitative guidance, including for conduct risk, and incorporates stress testing to dynamically assess capital, liquidity, and risk positions. The Board of Directors plays a critical oversight role, ensuring the RAF aligns with regulatory expectations and supports a strong risk culture. Conduct risk is monitored qualitatively within the RAF, reflecting its impact on reputation and compliance. Stress tests serve as key tools embedded in the RAF to inform risk appetite assessments and management actions. This ecosystem highlights the interconnected roles of governance bodies, risk management functions, and analytical tools in maintaining robust financial compliance and risk mitigation.\",\n  \"findings\": [\n    {\n      \"summary\": \"The Risk Appetite Framework (RAF) as the cornerstone of risk governance\",\n      \"explanation\": \"The RAF is a comprehensive, formal structure approved by the Board of Directors and senior management of an AI, defining the types and levels of risk acceptable in pursuit of strategic and business objectives. It includes risk appetite statements, quantitative risk limits at both business unit and group levels, and qualitative guidance for less quantifiable risks such as legal, reputational, and conduct risks. The RAF guides risk-taking activities to ensure alignment with the AI's risk capacity, strategic goals, and regulatory requirements. It is embedded institution-wide, involving leadership at multiple levels to foster a strong risk culture.
