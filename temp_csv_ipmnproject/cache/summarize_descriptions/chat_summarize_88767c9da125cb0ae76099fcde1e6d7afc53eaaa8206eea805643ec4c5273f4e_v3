This system is supported by robust policies, procedures, internal controls, and organizational structures aligned with actual operations to ensure effective risk oversight and mitigation.\n\nKey components of the RISK MANAGEMENT SYSTEM include active and ongoing oversight by the Board and senior management, clearly defined roles and responsibilities (including segregation of control functions from risk-taking activities), and established limits and guidelines to manage risk exposures across business units. The system incorporates qualitative and quantitative risk measurement methods, such as expert judgment, internal rating systems, stress testing, sensitivity and scenario analyses, fair valuation, and back-testing, to ensure accuracy, reliability, and forward-looking risk assessment.\n\nRisk data aggregation, management information systems, and risk reporting mechanisms are integral to the framework, enabling timely and reliable communication of risk profiles and exposures to the Board, Risk Committee, and senior management. The system also includes reconciliation, validation, and control processes—both automated and manual—to maintain data integrity and support compliance with regulatory requirements.\n\nInternal audit and control reviews are conducted regularly to detect deficiencies and ensure corrective actions are taken promptly. The framework also encompasses procedures for assessing risks related to new or changed products, exceptional transactions, and emergency or crisis situations, ensuring resilience and sound operational practices.\n\nThe effectiveness of the RISK MANAGEMENT SYSTEM is a critical focus of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) supervisory framework and is evaluated during supervisory assessments and risk-focused examinations. The system’s strength influences the CAMEL rating assigned to AIs, reflecting the institution’s overall risk management quality. The HKMA assesses the system based on four fundamental elements: active Board and senior management oversight; effective organizational policies, procedures, and limits; adequate risk measurement, monitoring, and management reporting systems; and comprehensive internal controls including independent internal audit functions.\n\nOverall, the RISK MANAGEMENT SYSTEM within AIs represents a holistic approach to managing the eight types of inherent risks identified by the HKMA, ensuring safe and sound operations, regulatory compliance, and sustainable business performance.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 440, "prompt_tokens": 1406, "total_tokens": 1846, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
