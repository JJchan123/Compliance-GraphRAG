The CRO oversees the identification, assessment, monitoring, and control of all material risks across the AI, including risks related to new products and services, anti-money laundering and counter-financing of terrorism (AML/CFT), capital and liquidity planning, and adherence to the institution’s approved risk appetite and limits.\n\nAppointed by and reporting directly to the AI’s Chief Executive, the CRO maintains sufficient independence and authority to challenge business proposals from a risk perspective, without holding management or financial responsibilities tied to revenue-generating functions. The CRO regularly reports to the Board or its Risk Committee on the institution’s evolving risk profile, risk culture, breaches of risk limits, and other significant risk-related developments, thereby supporting effective risk governance and oversight.\n\nThe CRO coordinates risk management activities across all business units, ensuring effective communication of risk issues to senior management and the Board. This role includes maintaining a centralized register of approved products and services, overseeing the rollout of new or significantly changed products, and requiring formal approval for significant changes to existing offerings. The CRO also participates in key strategic decision-making processes such as new product approvals, remuneration design, and setting risk-related performance indicators for business units.\n\nThe Board or its designated committee is responsible for approving the CRO’s appointment, reviewing their performance and remuneration, and publicly disclosing the appointment. The CRO ensures prompt action is taken when risk exposures approach or exceed approved limits, coordinating necessary responses with senior management to mitigate potential adverse impacts on the institution. Overall, the Chief Risk Officer plays a critical role in embedding a strong risk culture and ensuring robust risk management practices within the Authorized Institution.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 357, "prompt_tokens": 1078, "total_tokens": 1435, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
