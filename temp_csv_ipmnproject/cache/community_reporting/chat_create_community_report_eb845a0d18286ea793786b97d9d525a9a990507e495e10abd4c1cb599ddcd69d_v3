The framework integrates key elements such as risk governance arrangements, risk mitigation strategies, allocation of resources, systems and controls, and contingency planning to ensure effective identification, assessment, and management of risks. The AI's Risk Appetite, formally approved by the Board of Directors, guides the risk management process and must comply with applicable regulatory requirements. These entities and their interrelationships collectively support robust risk management practices aligned with business objectives and regulatory standards.\",\n  \"findings\": [\n    {\n      \"summary\": \"Comprehensive Risk Management Framework as the central structure\",\n      \"explanation\": \"The Risk Management Framework serves as the foundational system within Authorized Institutions, encompassing policies, procedures, controls, and governance arrangements designed to manage risks effectively across the organization. It is developed and approved by the Board and implemented by senior management to align with the AI's strategic goals and risk appetite. The framework includes internal controls, audits, compliance functions, contingency planning, and risk management tools such as limits, capital and liquidity management strategies, stress testing, and scenario analyses. This comprehensive approach ensures timely and accurate communication of material risk information to relevant stakeholders, facilitating early risk mitigation and maintaining institutional safety and soundness.
