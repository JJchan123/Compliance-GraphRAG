-Goal-
Given a text document that is potentially relevant to this activity, first identify all entities needed from the text in order to capture the information and ideas in the text.
Next, report all relationships among the identified entities.

-Steps-
1. Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:
- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized
- entity_type: Suggest several labels or categories for the entity. The categories should not be specific, but should be as general as possible.
- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities
Format each entity as ("entity"{tuple_delimiter}<entity_name>{tuple_delimiter}<entity_type>{tuple_delimiter}<entity_description>)

2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.
For each pair of related entities, extract the following information:
- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1
- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1
- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other
- relationship_strength: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity
Format each relationship as ("relationship"{tuple_delimiter}<source_entity>{tuple_delimiter}<target_entity>{tuple_delimiter}<relationship_description>{tuple_delimiter}<relationship_strength>)

3. Return output in English as a single list of all the entities and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **{record_delimiter}** as the list delimiter.

4. If you have to translate into English, just translate the descriptions, nothing else!

5. When finished, output {completion_delimiter}.

# 1. Supervisory framework

# 1.1 Introduction

1.1.1 The objective of the supervisory framework of the HKMA is to provide an effective process to monitor and assess the safety and soundness of Als on a continuing basis. The process follows a risk-based approach. It consists of a structured methodology designed to establish a forward-looking view on the risk profile of Als. This permits a direct and specific focus on the areas of greatest risk to an AI. It also enables the HKMA to be

more proactive and better positioned to pre-empt any serious threat to the stability of the banking system from any current or emerging risks.

1.1.2 The adoption of a well-structured risk-based framework allows the HKMA to continue to deliver consistent, high-quality supervision as the banking sector develops and risk profiles of Als change in reaction to competitive forces. This should also benefit Als as regulatory effort is focused on high-risk areas warranting management attention.

# 1.2 Key benefits

1.2.1 The key benefits for both the HKMA and Als from this risk-based supervisory framework are:

- better evaluation of risks through separate assessment of inherent risks and risk management processes;  
- greater emphasis on early identification of emerging risks at individual Als and on a sector-wide basis;  
- cost-effective use of resources through a sharper focus on risks, which in time should result in examination teams spending less time on site at individual AIs;  
- more utilisation by the HKMA of management information prepared by AIs;  
- a better appreciation by supervisors of the management quality of Als, the characteristics of their business and the risks they face;  
- enhanced value of the supervisory work performed to both the management of Als and the supervisors, who have a common interest in ensuring that risks are properly identified and that adequate and effective control systems are established to monitor and control risks; and  
cost of supervision, in terms of management time of an AI, will be more directly related to the AI's

risk profile, i.e. the intensity of supervision and the amount and focus of supervisory action will increase or decrease in line with the perceived risk profile of the AI.

# 1.3 Integration with CAMEL rating system

1.3.1 The CAMEL  $^{{1}}$  rating system, which has been implemented at the HKMA since 1995, is designed to assess in a comprehensive manner an Al's financial condition, compliance with laws and regulations, risk management systems and overall operating soundness. Its primary purpose is to help identify those Als where weaknesses in the aforementioned areas require special supervisory attention or warrant a higher than normal degree of supervisory concern.  
1.3.2 Risk-based supervision is a dynamic and forward-looking approach, which provides the supervisory process with the necessary framework to factor the risk profile of an AI into the CAMEL rating system. Risk-taking has always been present in the banking business, and rightfully so, but has increased significantly, primarily due to the need to remain competitive in a fast-paced environment.  
1.3.3 The risk-based methodology incorporates the risk profile, which is ascertained by balancing the level of inherent risk with the quality of risk management systems at Als, into the CAMEL rating system. Each of the CAMEL components is, as shown in the following diagram, affected by one or more of the eight inherent risks (credit, market, interest rate, liquidity, operational, legal, reputation and strategic), which the HKMA has identified as risks to be assessed during the supervisory process. These eight inherent risks are described in section 2 below.

1.3.4 Under the risk-based approach, a change in the CAMEL rating of an AI may result from the qualitative analysis of its risk profile in addition to the more traditional quantitative analysis of its financial data. An example of such a change would be a down-grade in asset quality to a "3" for an AI which displays current indicators representing an asset quality of "2" but whose credit risk, as a result of recent aggressive lending practices and less than satisfactory credit risk management systems, has been assessed as high.  
1.3.5 This approach to supervision does not eliminate or change the quantitative approach to assessing the components of the CAMEL rating system but it adds a new dimension, which enables the supervisory process to inject more judgement, based on a forward perspective, in arriving at a final rating.  
1.3.6 The risk-focused examination process places more emphasis on an evaluation of the quality of risk management systems and internal controls. A risk management rating is assigned taking into account the results of the on-site examination and formally incorporated into the management component of the CAMEL rating. It may also influence the ratings given to the other CAMEL components, as illustrated in para. 1.3.4 above. Section 3 below gives details of the four elements of a sound risk management system and

section 4 describes the risk management rating system.

# 1.4 Risk-based approach and methodology

1.4.1 The risk-based supervisory approach, which emphasises effective planning and examiner judgement, customises examinations to suit the size and activities of Als and to concentrate examiner resources on areas that expose the AI concerned to the greatest degree of risk.  
1.4.2 The risk-based methodology, shown in the diagram below, consists of six key steps.

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-10-17/4b70d29d-a521-4c6c-92cd-b0442bf201e9/c05683f27efb1419a5707dc1c6cce63d95e0efd93d3792ed4d42c4ee3d32f185.jpg)

1.4.3 The first step in the risk-based methodology, Understanding the AI, requires the preparation of an Institutional Overview document.  
1.4.4 The Institutional Overview provides a concise portrait of an Al's structure and financial condition. It summarises key business lines and functions, the business strategy and any planned introduction of new products, describes legal structure and financial condition and identifies problem issues related to the Al itself or its affiliated entities, such as domestic or foreign subsidiaries and

branches.

1.4.5 Information provided in the Institutional Overview is determined by the complexity of the AI and is primarily based upon internal and public sources of data, as well as information gathered from on-site visitations.  
1.4.6 The second step in the risk-based methodology, Assessing the Risk, results in the completion of a Risk Assessment Narrative.  
1.4.7 The risk assessment exercise is designed to identify the type, level and direction of risks of an AI.  
1.4.8 In order to conduct this exercise effectively, a building-block approach is used in which each of the significant activities of the AI is assessed with respect to the level of each of the inherent risks and the risk management systems in place to manage these risks.  
1.4.9 The objective of the risk assessment exercise is to develop a comprehensive risk profile, which captures all the eight types of inherent risks of the AI. Subsection 1.5 below describes the risk assessment process in more detail.  
1.4.10 The risk profile is used to complete the third and fourth steps in the risk-based methodology, which are Planning the Supervisory Work and Defining Examination Activities. The document to be prepared for these two steps is the Planning and Scope Memorandum. The HKMA will try to customise examination tasks so that they are consistent with the complexity and risk profile of the AI.  
1.4.11 The emphasis of the risk-focused examination to be performed in step five is on evaluating the effectiveness of the risk management system of the AI for each type of inherent risks. As previously indicated in para. 1.3.6, a risk management rating is assigned taking into account the on-site examination results, and factored into the management component of the CAMEL rating. The risk management rating may also affect the rating for one or more of the other CAMEL components. A report of examination will then be produced in this step to capture the examination findings and results from the review of the

CAMEL rating.

1.4.12 As the risk-based supervisory methodology revolves around a process of continuing off-site supervision, the Institutional Overview produced in step one will be constantly updated throughout the year in step six, making it a dynamic document which always reflects the most current position of the AI.

# 1.5 Risk assessment

1.5.1 The development of a formal risk assessment process represents an important addition to the HKMA's supervisory approach. The purpose of this risk assessment undertaking is, as indicated earlier, to identify the type, level and direction of all significant risks of an AI. The process consists of determining the level of risk in each of the eight inherent risks by business activity, the direction of risk, the adequacy of existing risk management systems and the impact, if any, of external risk factors.
