The BO mandates that AIs maintain adequate accounting systems and systems of control to ensure prudent business operations, safeguard assets, minimize fraud risk, monitor risks, and comply with legal and regulatory requirements. The Seventh Schedule to the Banking Ordinance specifically requires these controls and systems. Section 59(2) of the BO empowers the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) to require independent validation of remedial actions taken by AIs, which can be conducted by internal audit functions or independent external advisers. These entities and provisions form a tightly interconnected ecosystem focused on governance, risk management, and compliance oversight within the banking sector.\",\n  \"findings\": [\n    {\n      \"summary\": \"The Banking Ordinance (BO) as the principal regulatory framework\",\n      \"explanation\": \"The Banking Ordinance (BO) (Cap.155) serves as the foundational legislative framework governing banking operations in Hong Kong. It mandates that Authorized Institutions maintain adequate accounting systems and robust internal controls to ensure prudent business conduct, asset safeguarding, fraud risk minimization, risk monitoring, and compliance with all applicable legal and regulatory requirements. The BO also grants the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) statutory authority to supervise and enforce regulatory compliance among Authorized Institutions, including issuing AML/CFT guidelines and enforcing remedial actions.

These systems are essential to ensure prudent business operations, safeguard assets, minimize fraud risk, monitor risk exposures, and comply with legal and regulatory requirements.
