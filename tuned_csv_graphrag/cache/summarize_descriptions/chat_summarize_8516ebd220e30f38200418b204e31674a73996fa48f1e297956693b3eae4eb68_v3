It is recognized by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) as one of the eight inherent risks that must be assessed and managed under its supervisory framework. This risk encompasses various components, including repricing risk, basis risk, options risk, and yield curve risk. Effective management of interest rate risk involves implementing risk limits and policies, evaluating the AI’s funding strategy, and considering the impact of the overall business strategy on interest rate exposure.
