These limits define the maximum acceptable level of risk the institution is willing to assume across various risk categories, including those arising from new products, services, or business activities, and extend to specific risks such as AML/CFT exposures. Risk limits are derived from the AI’s overall risk appetite framework and are applied at multiple organizational levels—ranging from individual business units to the group level—enabling aggregation and disaggregation of risk exposures to ensure comprehensive oversight.\n\nSenior management holds responsibility for ensuring that risk exposures remain within these established limits, including under stressed conditions, while the Chief Risk Officer actively monitors adherence and reports any material breaches to the Board and the Risk Committee. The internal audit function also plays a critical role in monitoring breaches to ensure they are identified, escalated, and reported appropriately. Risk limits are designed to be clear, objective, and tailored to the size, complexity, and sophistication of the institution’s business activities and products. They are regularly reviewed, communicated to relevant staff, and monitored for utilization, with exceptions promptly reported to maintain effective governance and proactive risk control within the institution’s risk-adjusted performance measurement systems.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 257, "prompt_tokens": 1078, "total_tokens": 1335, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
