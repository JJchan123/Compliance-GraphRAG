Four elements of a sound risk management system. version: V.2-23.12.2022. following key factors are to be considered in evaluating the adequacy of policies, procedures and limits: whether policies, procedures and limits are properly documented, drawn up after careful consideration of the risks associated with the activity and reviewed and approved by management at the appropriate level; whether policies assign full accountability and clear lines of authority for each activity and product area; and whether compliance monitoring procedures have been developed. These procedures should include internal compliance checks for adherence to all policies, procedures and limits by an independent function within an AI such as an internal control unit. 3.4 Risk measurement, monitoring and management reporting systems 3.4.1 Effective risk monitoring requires AIs to identify and measure all quantifiable and material risk factors. Consequently, risk monitoring activities must be supported by information systems that provide the management with timely and accurate reports on the financial condition, operating performance and risk exposure of the AI. 3.4.2 Management information systems should provide regular and sufficiently detailed reports for line managers engaged in the day-to-day management of the AI's business activities. 3.4.3 All AIs are expected to have risk monitoring and management information systems that provide senior management with a clear understanding of the AI's positions and risk exposures. 3.4.4 The following factors should be considered in assessing the effectiveness of the risk measurement, monitoring and management reporting systems: the adequacy, on a historical basis, of the risk monitoring practices and reports addressing all material risks of the organisation; the adequacy and appropriateness of the key assumptions, data sources and procedures used to measure and monitor risk, including the adequacy of analysis, documentation and reliability testing of the system on a continuing basis; any material changes in the AI's lines of business or products that might require changes in the measuring and monitoring systems; any changes in the information technology or management information system environment that have significantly changed the production process for reports or the assumptions on which reports are based; how consistently management information reports and other forms of communication monitor)\n\n<|COMPLETE|>", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 554, "prompt_tokens": 1576, "total_tokens": 2130, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 1024, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
