This penalty serves as a deterrent against future violations, reinforcing the importance of adherence to regulatory standards. The financial penalty can be substantial, potentially reaching up to $10,000,000 or three times the profit gained from the contravention of the provisions outlined in the Anti-Money Laundering Ordinance (AMLO).
