The effectiveness of the risk management system plays a crucial role in shaping the risk profile of an AI (Authorized Institution), as it dictates the processes through which risks are identified, assessed, and managed. Conversely, the risk profile of the Authorized Institution serves as a foundational element that informs the design and implementation of its risk management system.
