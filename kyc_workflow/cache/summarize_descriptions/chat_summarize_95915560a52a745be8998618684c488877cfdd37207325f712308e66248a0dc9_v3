Within this framework, \"Enhanced Customer Due Diligence\" (ECDD) serves as a critical component, requiring these institutions to conduct additional, more rigorous scrutiny for customers identified as higher risk. This means that when a customer is assessed to pose greater potential risks—such as those related to money laundering, terrorist financing, or other financial crimes—Authorized Institutions must implement heightened verification, monitoring, and investigative measures beyond standard due diligence. Together, the Risk-Based Approach and Enhanced Customer Due Diligence ensure that financial organizations allocate resources efficiently and maintain effective governance and risk management by focusing intensified compliance efforts where they are most needed.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 155, "prompt_tokens": 293, "total_tokens": 448, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
