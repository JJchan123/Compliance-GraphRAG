This process is essential for AIs as it measures the sensitivity of their earnings to variations in individual risk factors, such as interest rates, which is vital for effective risk management. Furthermore, Sensitivity Analysis serves as a technique to assess how different values of an independent variable impact a specific dependent variable under a defined set of assumptions, making it crucial for understanding risk exposure.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 115, "prompt_tokens": 324, "total_tokens": 439, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
