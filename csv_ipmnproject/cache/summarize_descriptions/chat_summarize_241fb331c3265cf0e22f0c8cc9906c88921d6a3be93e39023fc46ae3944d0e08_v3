This risk is recognized as one of the eight inherent risks assessed by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) and is crucial for the long-term viability of AIs. It encompasses the potential adverse effects on earnings, capital, reputation, or standing that may arise from poor business decisions, improper implementation of those decisions, or a failure to respond adequately to changes in the industry, economy, or technology. Furthermore, strategic risk is identified as a material risk area that must be addressed in risk management reports and should be evaluated in the context of new products or services introduced by AIs. Overall, effective management of strategic risk is essential for maintaining compliance and ensuring the sustainability of financial institutions.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 176, "prompt_tokens": 494, "total_tokens": 670, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
