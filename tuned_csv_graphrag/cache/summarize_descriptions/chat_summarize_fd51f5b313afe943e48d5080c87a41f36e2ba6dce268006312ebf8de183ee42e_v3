It encompasses the potential for financial loss or operational disruption arising from legal actions, non-compliance with laws or regulations, unenforceable or uncertain contracts, and adverse judgments. This risk includes uncertainties related to the applicability or interpretation of contracts, laws, or regulations, which may lead to lawsuits or regulatory penalties. Legal risk is often less quantifiable and is monitored through qualitative indicators within the risk appetite framework.
