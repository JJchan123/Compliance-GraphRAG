They simulate adverse or stressed scenarios to evaluate the institution's risk profile, particularly focusing on capital, liquidity, and other risk positions. By providing a dynamic assessment of potential vulnerabilities, stress tests enable institutions to proactively identify risks and prepare mitigation strategies. This process is essential for maintaining the institution's resilience against unfavorable market or economic conditions and supports compliance with regulatory expectations.
