These deficiencies can expose AIs to various regulatory actions and penalties, as they may fail to meet established compliance standards. Furthermore, such inadequacies in AML and CFT systems can result in heightened supervisory scrutiny from regulatory bodies, increasing the likelihood of potential sanctions against the institutions involved. Overall, the presence of these deficiencies underscores the critical need for robust compliance frameworks to mitigate risks associated with financial crimes and ensure adherence to regulatory requirements.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 130, "prompt_tokens": 288, "total_tokens": 418, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
