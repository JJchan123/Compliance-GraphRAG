The policy is designed to systematically assess and manage customer risks, particularly focusing on anti-money laundering (AML) and counter-financing of terrorism (CFT) concerns. Key entities include various customer risk types such as Politically Exposed Persons (PEPs), high net worth individuals, money changers and casinos, customers from higher risk jurisdictions, and those with complex ownership structures. The policy establishes internal governance mechanisms, including management approval levels for business relationships, especially for higher risk customers. These relationships and classifications enable AIs to apply a risk-based approach for due diligence and ongoing monitoring, ensuring compliance with regulatory standards and effective risk mitigation.\",\n  \"findings\": [\n    {\n      \"summary\": \"Customer Acceptance Policy as the central governance framework\",\n      \"explanation\": \"The Customer Acceptance Policy serves as the foundational framework within Authorized Institutions for assessing, classifying, and managing customers based on their risk profiles. It incorporates detailed guidelines that enable institutions to evaluate customers using various risk indicators such as nationality, business nature, and account activity deviations. This policy empowers institutions to reclassify customers as higher risk when warranted and delineates management approval levels for onboarding and maintaining such customers. By doing so, it ensures robust governance and compliance with AML/CFT regulatory standards, forming the backbone of risk management and supervisory oversight within the banking sector [Data: Entities (376); Relationships (622, 632, 625, 627, 629, 631, 641)].\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"summary\": \"Risk-based approach underpins customer due diligence\",\n      \"explanation\": \"The Customer Acceptance Policy is explicitly based on a risk-based approach framework, which mandates differentiated due diligence measures according to the assessed risk level of customers. This approach allows Authorized Institutions to allocate resources efficiently by focusing enhanced scrutiny on higher risk customers, thereby strengthening AML/CFT controls. The risk-based approach is critical for effective supervisory processes and aligns with international regulatory expectations, ensuring that institutions maintain vigilant and proportionate risk management practices [Data: Relationships (622)].\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"summary\": \"Enhanced due diligence for Politically Exposed Persons (PEPs)\",\n      \"explanation\": \"Politically Exposed Persons represent a high-risk customer category due to their potential involvement in corruption and financial crime.
