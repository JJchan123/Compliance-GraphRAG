Central to this ecosystem are the Board of Directors and Senior Management within AIs, who collaboratively oversee risk governance, including the approval and implementation of risk management policies, risk appetite frameworks, and AML/CFT systems. The Board delegates specific responsibilities to specialized committees such as the Risk Committee and Remuneration Committee, ensuring independent oversight and alignment of incentives with risk culture. The Chief Risk Officer and internal control functions provide independent risk monitoring and control, supported by management information systems that deliver timely and accurate risk reporting. The HKMA engages with these entities through annual board meetings and supervisory examinations to assess management quality, risk exposures, and compliance effectiveness. Together, these entities and their interrelationships form a comprehensive framework that supports robust financial compliance, risk mitigation, and regulatory oversight within the banking sector.\",\n  \"findings\": [\n    {\n      \"summary\": \"Central role of the Board of Directors in risk governance and oversight\",\n      \"explanation\": \"The Board of Directors holds ultimate responsibility for risk management within Authorized Institutions, including approving risk management policies, risk appetite statements, and overseeing risk exposures and management activities. It ensures that risk-taking aligns with the institution's strategic objectives and regulatory requirements. The Board also promotes regular and transparent communication mechanisms, oversees internal control functions, and monitors disciplinary actions related to excessive risk-taking. Specialized Board-level committees, such as the Risk Committee and Remuneration Committee, operate under the Board's mandate to carry out specific risk management tasks and ensure remuneration systems align with risk culture. The Board's oversight extends to ensuring the independence and competence of risk management staff and reviewing stress testing and scenario analyses to assess risk resilience [Data: Entities (17, 430, 441), Relationships (69, 864, 902, 955, 956, 396, 866, 894, 896, 910, 911, 912, 913, 914, 915, 916, 917, 929, 932, 934, 961, 1154, 1155, 794, 795, 895, 931, 933, 959, 960)].\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"summary\": \"Senior Management as the operational link executing Board directives and managing risk frameworks\",\n      \"explanation\": \"Senior Management is responsible for the day-to-day implementation and operation of the institution's risk management framework as approved by the Board.

Senior Management compiles comprehensive risk reports for the Board, fosters a strong risk culture, and oversees AML/CFT systems to meet regulatory standards. They also address regulatory feedback from the HKMA and participate in prudential meetings. Senior Management uses stress-testing outcomes to develop risk mitigating measures and provides high-level attention to material weaknesses, ensuring corrective actions are implemented.
