The process is a comprehensive risk management and governance mechanism involving multiple layers of oversight, including senior management, the Board or its Risk Committee, and key risk management functions. It ensures that all risks, including financial, operational, compliance, and AML/CFT risks, are thoroughly assessed and managed before launching new products or services. The process is closely linked with risk mitigation strategies, system enhancements, capital strength, liquidity resources, and risk reporting procedures.
