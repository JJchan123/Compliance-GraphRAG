The key entities include the AIs themselves, jurisdictions with inadequate AML/CFT standards, and supervisory measures such as withdrawal from these jurisdictions.

This exposes the institutions to elevated AML/CFT risks, necessitating enhanced controls and supervisory oversight to manage potential vulnerabilities in their risk management frameworks.
