This process includes risk assessment, on-site examinations, off-site reviews, and other supervisory engagements, all conducted with an intensity and focus proportional to the money laundering and terrorist financing (ML/TF) risks associated with different banking segments and individual AIs. The HKMA actively monitors the implementation and effectiveness of AML/CFT systems, communicates findings and expectations to senior management and boards, and mandates remedial actions to address identified deficiencies. Through these activities, the supervisory process ensures robust governance, risk management, and regulatory compliance within the authorized banking institutions under its jurisdiction.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 163, "prompt_tokens": 358, "total_tokens": 521, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
