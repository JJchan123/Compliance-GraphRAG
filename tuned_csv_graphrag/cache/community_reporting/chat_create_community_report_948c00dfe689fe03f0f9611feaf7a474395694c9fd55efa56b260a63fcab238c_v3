The primary entities include the referral process itself and two critical legislative frameworks: the Drug Trafficking (Recovery of Proceeds) Ordinance (DTROP) and the Organized and Serious Crimes Ordinance (OSCO). The referral process acts as a conduit whereby the HKMA escalates suspected violations by AIs to law enforcement agencies for further investigation or prosecution. This relationship underscores the HKMA's supervisory role in enforcing compliance with AML/CFT regulations and combating serious financial crimes within the banking sector.\",\n  \"findings\": [\n    {\n      \"summary\": \"Referral to Law Enforcement as a Key Compliance Enforcement Mechanism\",\n      \"explanation\": \"The referral to law enforcement entity represents a critical compliance enforcement tool within the HKMA's supervisory framework. It formalizes the process by which suspected violations of relevant legislation by Authorized Institutions are escalated for criminal investigation or prosecution. This mechanism ensures that breaches of AML/CFT laws and serious crime statutes do not remain solely within regulatory oversight but are subject to judicial scrutiny, thereby reinforcing deterrence and accountability in the financial sector. The referral process is integral to maintaining the integrity of the banking system and upholding public trust.

Authorized Institutions under HKMA supervision are obligated to comply with DTROP provisions, and any violations detected by the HKMA are subject to referral to law enforcement. This ordinance empowers the HKMA to monitor and enforce AML controls specifically related to drug trafficking proceeds, highlighting the targeted approach in the regulatory framework to combat specific categories of financial crime.
