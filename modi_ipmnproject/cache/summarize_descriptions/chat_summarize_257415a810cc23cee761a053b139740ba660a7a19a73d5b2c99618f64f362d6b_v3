These limits are crucial for ensuring that risk exposures are monitored and controlled within acceptable levels, aligning with the institution's overall risk appetite. By setting these predefined thresholds, the AI can effectively manage its risk-taking activities, ensuring that they remain within acceptable boundaries as determined by the organization's risk management framework.
