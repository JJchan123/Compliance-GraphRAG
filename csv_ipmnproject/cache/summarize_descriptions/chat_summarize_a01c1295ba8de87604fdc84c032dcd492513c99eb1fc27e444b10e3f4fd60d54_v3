This process is essential for ensuring that these offerings align with the institution's risk appetite and management practices. It encompasses the evaluation of exposure to money laundering (ML) and terrorist financing (TF) risks, which is critical for compliance with Anti-Money Laundering and Counter Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT) policies mandated by regulatory bodies such as the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA).\n\nThe risk assessment process serves as the foundation for developing effective risk management strategies, allowing AIs to determine the potential impact of identified risks on their operations. It involves coordinated efforts to minimize, monitor, and control the likelihood or consequences of adverse events. Furthermore, this process is recognized as a critical responsibility of the Board and senior management within AIs, ensuring that informed decision-making is at the forefront of their operational practices. Overall, risk assessment is a vital component of maintaining compliance and fostering a robust risk management framework within financial institutions.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 224, "prompt_tokens": 498, "total_tokens": 722, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
