FATF-style regional bodies (FSRBs) operate within various regions under the framework and standards set by the FATF. These regional bodies adopt and implement FATF’s international standards to promote AML/CFT compliance tailored to their specific regional contexts. By aligning their policies and enforcement mechanisms with FATF guidance, FATF-style regional bodies play a critical role in extending the FATF’s global mandate, ensuring consistent and effective governance, risk management, and regulatory oversight across different jurisdictions.
