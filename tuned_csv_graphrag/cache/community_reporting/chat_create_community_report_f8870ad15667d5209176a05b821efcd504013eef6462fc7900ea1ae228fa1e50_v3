On-site examinations are detailed, location-based evaluations assessing AIs' risk management, internal controls, and AML/CFT systems, which directly influence risk management ratings such as CAMEL. Risk profiling is a critical supervisory process that assesses money laundering and terrorist financing risks of AIs, guiding the frequency and scope of on-site examinations. Trigger events like mergers, acquisitions, or business model changes prompt reassessment of ML/TF risks via risk profiling, thereby affecting supervisory focus and examination schedules. The relationships among these entities illustrate a dynamic, risk-sensitive supervisory ecosystem aimed at ensuring robust governance, compliance, and risk mitigation within Hong Kong's banking sector.\",\n  \"findings\": [\n    {\n      \"summary\": \"On-site examinations are comprehensive supervisory activities assessing AIs' risk management and AML/CFT systems.\",\n      \"explanation\": \"The ON-SITE EXAMINATION conducted by the HKMA involves examiners performing detailed, on-location evaluations of Authorized Institutions. These examinations assess the institutions’ risk management systems, internal controls, and overall risk exposures. They also include focused reviews of Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT) systems using risk-focused and thematic approaches tailored to each AI's specific risk profile. The outcomes of these examinations serve as a critical basis for determining risk management ratings and making adjustments to CAMEL ratings, thereby directly influencing supervisory decisions and regulatory compliance enforcement [Data: Entities (37)].\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"summary\": \"Risk profiling informs the scope and frequency of on-site examinations for AIs.\",\n      \"explanation\": \"RISK PROFILING is a supervisory process used by the HKMA to assess the money laundering and terrorist financing risks of Authorized Institutions. The results of risk profiling determine how often and how extensively on-site examinations are conducted. This ensures that supervisory resources are allocated efficiently and that higher-risk institutions receive more focused scrutiny. The bidirectional relationship between risk profiling and on-site examinations highlights a feedback loop where risk assessments guide examinations, and examination findings can refine risk profiles [Data: Entities (257); Relationships (478, 482)].\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"summary\": \"Merger or acquisition events act as triggers for reassessing ML/TF risk profiles of AIs.\",\n      \"explanation\": \"MERGER OR ACQUISITION events are recognized as significant trigger events that may affect the risk profile of an Authorized Institution.
