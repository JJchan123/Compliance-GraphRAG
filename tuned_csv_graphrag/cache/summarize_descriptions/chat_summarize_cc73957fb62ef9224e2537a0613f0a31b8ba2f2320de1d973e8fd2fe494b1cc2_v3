It establishes the boundaries and tolerance levels for risk-taking, thereby directing the formulation and implementation of risk management policies and controls within the AI (presumably the Artificial Intelligence or relevant organizational unit). Conversely, the Risk Management Policy governs and formalizes the establishment of the Risk Appetite Framework, ensuring that it operates within a structured and compliant framework.
