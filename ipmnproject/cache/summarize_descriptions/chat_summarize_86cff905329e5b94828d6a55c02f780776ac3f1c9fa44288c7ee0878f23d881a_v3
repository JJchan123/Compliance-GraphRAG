These limits are crucial for managing risk effectively, as they help organizations monitor and mitigate potential losses that could arise from their operations. \n\nIn addition to traditional risk management practices, RISK LIMITS can also be set by artificial intelligence (AI) systems. These AI-driven thresholds are designed to manage and monitor risk exposure across different business lines and units, enhancing the organization's ability to respond to dynamic market conditions and emerging risks. By leveraging AI, organizations can achieve a more nuanced understanding of their risk profiles and adjust their limits accordingly to ensure they remain within acceptable boundaries.\n\nOverall, RISK LIMITS serve as a vital tool for organizations to maintain financial stability and operational integrity by systematically controlling their exposure to risk.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 164, "prompt_tokens": 184, "total_tokens": 348, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
