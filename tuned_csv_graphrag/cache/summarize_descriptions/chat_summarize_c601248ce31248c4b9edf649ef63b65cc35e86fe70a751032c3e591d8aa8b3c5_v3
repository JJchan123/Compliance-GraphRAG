This risk management rating is specifically integrated into the management component of the CAMEL framework. Moreover, the risk management rating not only influences the management component but can also impact other components within the CAMEL system, thereby affecting the overall CAMEL rating assigned to an Authorized Institution. This integration underscores the critical role of risk management assessments in evaluating the governance and operational soundness of financial institutions under the HKMA’s supervisory regime.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 119, "prompt_tokens": 385, "total_tokens": 504, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
