These systems encompass a range of processes, policies, procedures, and controls that are crucial for ensuring compliance with legal and regulatory requirements. The implementation of AML/CFT systems is subject to supervision by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA), which oversees the adherence to these frameworks. By effectively managing these systems, AIs not only work to thwart illicit financial activities but also strive to maintain access to banking services for legitimate businesses and individuals, thereby balancing regulatory compliance with the facilitation of lawful economic activities.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 137, "prompt_tokens": 426, "total_tokens": 563, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
