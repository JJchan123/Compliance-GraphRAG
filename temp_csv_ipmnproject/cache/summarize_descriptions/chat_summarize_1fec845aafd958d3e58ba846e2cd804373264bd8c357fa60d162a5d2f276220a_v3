This approach focuses on identifying and prioritizing the highest risks, including money laundering and terrorist financing (ML/TF) risks, by systematically gathering and analyzing information on the risk profiles and complexities of these institutions. By customizing supervisory examinations according to each AI’s specific risk profile and operational complexity, the HKMA effectively plans and conducts targeted assessments to ensure that Authorized Institutions manage risks prudently and maintain financial stability. This risk-based supervisory framework enables the HKMA to continuously oversee the evolving risk landscape within the banking sector, thereby safeguarding the integrity and soundness of Hong Kong’s financial system.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 154, "prompt_tokens": 492, "total_tokens": 646, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
