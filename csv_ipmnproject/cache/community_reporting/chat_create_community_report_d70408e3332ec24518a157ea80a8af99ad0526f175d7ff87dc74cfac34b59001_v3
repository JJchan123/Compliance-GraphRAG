It refers to the potential loss that financial institutions may incur due to a borrower's failure to make payments. The HKMA mandates that AIs assess and manage credit risk as part of their compliance obligations. This involves analyzing the probability of default and understanding the financial implications of such defaults, making it a critical focus area for AIs. The effective management of credit risk is essential for maintaining the stability and integrity of the financial system.

This strategy ensures that risk mitigation efforts are cohesive and aligned with regulatory standards. By integrating various policies and processes, AIs can address all material risks, including credit risk, thereby enhancing their overall resilience.

Changes in environmental conditions and shifting consumer expectations can lead to business disruptions, impacting borrowers' ability to repay debts. This relationship underscores the need for AIs to incorporate climate risk assessments into their credit risk management frameworks.
