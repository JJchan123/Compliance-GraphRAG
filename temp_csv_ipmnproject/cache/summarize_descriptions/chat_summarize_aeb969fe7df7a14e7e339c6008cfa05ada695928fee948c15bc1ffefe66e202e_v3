These entities are subject to a comprehensive, risk-based supervisory framework designed to ensure their safety, soundness, and compliance with regulatory standards. Under HKMA oversight, Authorized Institutions are required to implement and maintain effective Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT) systems, adopting risk-based approaches to customer due diligence (CDD), suspicious transaction reporting, and cooperation with law enforcement agencies to prevent money laundering and terrorist financing.\n\nIn addition to AML/CFT compliance, Authorized Institutions must establish robust risk management frameworks encompassing firm-wide risk identification, measurement, monitoring, and control. These frameworks include sound policies, procedures, and limits aligned with their risk appetite, supported by dedicated risk management functions such as a Chief Risk Officer and, where appropriate, a Risk Committee to oversee risk governance based on the institution’s size, complexity, and risk profile. Risk management responsibilities extend to business continuity, contingency funding, and recovery planning to ensure operational resilience during emergencies or crises.\n\nThe HKMA’s supervisory approach involves ongoing, risk-focused examinations, prudential meetings, and assessments using tools such as the CAMEL rating system and risk management ratings. Authorized Institutions undergo continuous risk profiling and supervisory oversight to evaluate inherent and emerging risks, including those related to international sanctions, correspondent banking, trade-related businesses, and cross-border payments. The HKMA also provides supervisory feedback and capacity-building initiatives to enhance compliance and risk management capabilities.\n\nOverall, Authorized Institutions play a critical role in maintaining Hong Kong’s financial stability by adhering to stringent regulatory requirements, implementing comprehensive AML/CFT controls, and sustaining effective risk management systems under the vigilant supervision of the HKMA.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 357, "prompt_tokens": 1641, "total_tokens": 1998, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
