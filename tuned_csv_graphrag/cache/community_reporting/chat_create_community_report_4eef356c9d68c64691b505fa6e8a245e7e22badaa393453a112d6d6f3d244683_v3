The framework is structured around a risk-based methodology, a six-step supervisory approach tailored to each AI's size, activities, and risk profile. Key entities include the Risk-Based Methodology, which guides the overall supervisory process; the Planning and Scope Memorandum, which customizes supervisory work and examination activities; and the Supervisory Work itself, encompassing risk assessments, examinations, and ongoing monitoring. These entities are interconnected, with the risk-based supervisory approach employing the risk-based methodology and the Planning and Scope Memorandum directing the supervisory work. This structure ensures a tailored, risk-sensitive regulatory oversight that enhances governance, risk management, and compliance within the banking sector.\",\n  \"findings\": [\n    {\n      \"summary\": \"Risk-Based Methodology as the Core Supervisory Framework\",\n      \"explanation\": \"The Risk-Based Methodology is the foundational six-step supervisory approach used by the HKMA to oversee Authorized Institutions. It involves understanding the institution, assessing risks, planning supervisory work, defining examination activities, performing risk-focused examinations, and conducting ongoing off-site supervision. This methodology allows customization of supervisory examinations based on each AI's unique size, activities, and risk profile, thereby enhancing governance and risk management within the financial sector. Its comprehensive nature ensures that supervisory efforts are both effective and efficient, focusing resources on areas of higher risk [Data: Entities (32)].\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"summary\": \"Planning and Scope Memorandum Tailors Supervisory Activities\",\n      \"explanation\": \"The Planning and Scope Memorandum is a critical supervisory document prepared during the risk-based supervisory process. It outlines the planning and scope of supervisory work and examination activities, specifically tailored to reflect the complexity and risk profile of each Authorized Institution. This memorandum serves as a customized framework guiding the focus and extent of supervisory efforts, ensuring that examination activities are appropriately aligned with the AI's unique risk characteristics and operational complexity. This targeted approach supports effective risk mitigation and compliance oversight [Data: Entities (16)].\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"summary\": \"Supervisory Work Encompasses Comprehensive Oversight Activities\",\n      \"explanation\": \"Supervisory Work refers to the activities performed by HKMA supervisors, including risk assessment, examinations, and ongoing monitoring. These activities aim to ensure the safety and soundness of Authorized Institutions by identifying and addressing potential risks.
