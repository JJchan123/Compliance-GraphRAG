These institutions are responsible for identifying, verifying, and continuously monitoring their customers and transactions to prevent financial crimes, including money laundering and terrorist financing. Customer due diligence processes encompass verifying customer identities, assessing money laundering and terrorist financing risks, and ensuring compliance with anti-money laundering (AML) and counter-financing of terrorism (CFT) regulatory requirements. Authorized Institutions may conduct CDD directly or rely on intermediaries to fulfill these obligations. Additionally, they apply these procedures specifically to parties involved in wire transfers and currency exchange transactions to meet regulatory standards. Overall, Authorized Institutions integrate CDD into their governance structures to mitigate AML/CFT risks effectively and uphold regulatory compliance.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 158, "prompt_tokens": 452, "total_tokens": 610, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
