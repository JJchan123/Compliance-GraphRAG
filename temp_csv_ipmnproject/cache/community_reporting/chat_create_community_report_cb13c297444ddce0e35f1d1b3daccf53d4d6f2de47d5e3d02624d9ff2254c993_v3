Key entities include the Risk Committee, Risk Management Framework, Risk Governance Arrangements, Remuneration System, and Risk Appetite, among others. The Risk Committee plays a pivotal role in overseeing risk management processes, supported by independent non-executive directors and the audit function. The framework integrates policies, procedures, systems, and controls to manage various risk types effectively. The remuneration system aligns incentives with the AI's risk culture and appetite to promote prudent risk-taking. Relationships among these entities ensure robust risk oversight, compliance with regulatory requirements, and proactive risk mitigation strategies, contributing to the stability and integrity of the financial system.\",\n  \"findings\": [\n    {\n      \"summary\": \"Central role of the Risk Committee in risk oversight\",\n      \"explanation\": \"The Risk Committee is a designated committee within an Authorized Institution, often part of the Board structure, responsible for overseeing the institution’s risk management processes. It receives direct reports from the Chief Risk Officer and ensures that all material risks are properly identified, assessed, managed, and communicated. The committee oversees stress testing, scenario analyses, capital management, and liquidity management to ensure alignment with the AI’s risk appetite. Additionally, systemically important Authorized Institutions are required to establish a Risk Committee to meet enhanced supervisory standards. This central role positions the Risk Committee as a critical entity in maintaining effective risk governance and compliance within the institution [Data: Entities (351, 488); Relationships (785, 1058, 1053, 1054, 1062)].\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"summary\": \"Comprehensive Risk Management Framework integrating governance and controls\",\n      \"explanation\": \"The Risk Management Framework within AIs is a structured system encompassing policies, procedures, controls, and governance arrangements designed to identify, assess, measure, monitor, and manage risks effectively.
