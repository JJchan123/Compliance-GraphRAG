This function is responsible for ongoing monitoring of correspondent banking activities, which includes reviewing transaction reports, scrutinizing suspicious fund transfers, and conducting compliance checks both domestically and in overseas units. To effectively mitigate risks, the compliance function must have access to comprehensive customer identity information, even in cases involving confidential numbered accounts. Additionally, for high-risk or sensitive private banking customers, the compliance function—or an independent control function such as parent banks or head offices of foreign subsidiaries or branches—may be required to provide additional approval to support regulatory compliance and risk management. The compliance function must be staffed with personnel of sufficient status, expertise, and resources to perform these duties effectively, ensuring robust governance and risk mitigation within the institution.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 184, "prompt_tokens": 483, "total_tokens": 667, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
