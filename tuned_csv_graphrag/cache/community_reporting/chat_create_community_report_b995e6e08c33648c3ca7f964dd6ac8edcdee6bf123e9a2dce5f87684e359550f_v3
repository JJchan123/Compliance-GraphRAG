The key entities include the 'Business Relationship,' defined as the substantive connection between an AI and its customer, and the 'Account Holder,' who is regarded as the customer for AML/CFT purposes when such a substantive relationship exists. The relationship between these entities is fundamental for assessing money laundering and terrorist financing risks and for fulfilling compliance obligations under the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing Ordinance (AMLO) and AML/CFT guidelines. This community highlights the importance of accurately identifying and managing these relationships to ensure effective risk management and regulatory compliance within the banking sector.\",\n  \"findings\": [\n    {\n      \"summary\": \"Business Relationship as a cornerstone for AML/CFT risk assessment\",\n      \"explanation\": \"The 'Business Relationship' entity represents the substantive connection between an Authorized Institution and its customer, which is pivotal in assessing money laundering and terrorist financing risks. This relationship forms the basis for determining the level of due diligence and ongoing monitoring required under the AMLO and AML/CFT guidelines.
