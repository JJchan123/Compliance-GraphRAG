This type of risk is characterized by uncertainties in the applicability or interpretation of contracts, making it a critical aspect of risk management for AIs. Legal risk is one of the eight inherent risks identified by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) that AIs must actively monitor and manage within their risk frameworks.
