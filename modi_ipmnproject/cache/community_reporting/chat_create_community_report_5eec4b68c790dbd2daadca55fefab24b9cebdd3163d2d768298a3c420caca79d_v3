This classification is essential for financial compliance as it helps organizations gauge their risk exposure and implement necessary measures to adhere to regulatory standards. AIs classified under this category are expected to have an average probability of potential loss, which can be managed within their normal business operations. This understanding is crucial for regulators and institutions alike, as it informs the level of scrutiny and oversight required.
