It is primarily responsible for overseeing the institution’s financial reporting, internal controls, and compliance functions. This includes approving key appointments such as the Head of Compliance and ensuring that the compliance function is appropriately resourced, authorized, and positioned within the organization. The Audit Committee plays a critical governance role by holding periodic meetings to facilitate effective information exchange with the Risk Committee, thereby ensuring that all material risks and related risk management processes undergo independent assessment by the internal audit function. Additionally, the committee reviews the adequacy and effectiveness of the AI’s risk management system, maintaining a clear separation of duties between audit oversight and risk management to uphold robust governance and risk management standards.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 157, "prompt_tokens": 431, "total_tokens": 588, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
