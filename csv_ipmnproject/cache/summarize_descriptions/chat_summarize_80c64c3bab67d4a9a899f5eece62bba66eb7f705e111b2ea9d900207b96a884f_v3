It mandates that individuals and organizations disclose any knowledge or suspicion regarding such property, thereby imposing significant legal risks for non-compliance. UNATMO is particularly relevant in the context of Anti-Money Laundering and Counter Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT) compliance, as it outlines the obligations and potential violations that may arise for Authorized Institutions (AIs) operating within the jurisdiction.
