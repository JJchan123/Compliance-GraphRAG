This framework is enforced primarily by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) through a combination of statutory powers, guidelines, circulars, seminars, and supervisory examinations. It applies specifically to Authorized Institutions, ensuring their compliance with AML/CFT standards by enabling the HKMA to conduct oversight and impose remedial actions when necessary. The AML/CFT regime thus serves as a critical mechanism to uphold financial integrity and combat illicit financial activities in Hong Kong’s banking sector.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 132, "prompt_tokens": 346, "total_tokens": 478, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
