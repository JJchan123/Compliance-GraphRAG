This control mechanism is essential in ensuring that no single individual has the authority to execute conflicting tasks, thereby reducing the risk of fraudulent activities and operational mistakes. By distributing responsibilities among different individuals or teams, segregation of duties enhances accountability and oversight within the AI's operations. This practice not only safeguards the integrity of the AI system but also promotes a more secure and reliable operational environment.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 100, "prompt_tokens": 187, "total_tokens": 287, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
