This approach allows the HKMA to differentiate compliance requirements according to the varying levels of risk associated with different customers, thereby promoting financial inclusion and preventing the exclusion of lower-risk customers. By expecting AIs to adopt this RBA, the HKMA aims to foster a more nuanced and effective compliance framework that aligns with the specific risk profiles of institutions and their clientele.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 110, "prompt_tokens": 288, "total_tokens": 398, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
