This profile is developed through a thorough risk assessment exercise that evaluates eight key inherent risk categories—credit, market, interest rate, liquidity, operational, reputation, strategic, legal, and compliance risks—alongside emerging risks. It integrates an evaluation of the adequacy and effectiveness of the AI’s risk management systems and considers external risk factors impacting the institution. The resulting overall risk profile provides a detailed characterization of the AI’s risk exposure at any given time, serving as a critical tool to guide supervisory planning, examination activities, and supervisory focus. Additionally, it represents a vital governance instrument that the Board and senior management rely upon to understand, monitor, and manage the institution’s risk landscape effectively.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 172, "prompt_tokens": 450, "total_tokens": 622, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
