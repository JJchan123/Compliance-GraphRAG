This system covers all eight inherent risk types as defined by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA), as well as any additional risks identified internally by the AI. It encompasses a wide range of activities including lending, trading, and treasury operations, supported by robust policies, procedures, limits, and controls designed to manage these risks.\n\nIntegral to the Risk Management System are processes for control, validation, reconciliation, and reporting of risk data, which incorporate both automated and manual checks to ensure data accuracy and integrity. The system is underpinned by management information systems that facilitate timely and effective risk monitoring and decision-making. Furthermore, the Risk Management System is subject to regular review and continuous enhancement to maintain its effectiveness and adapt to evolving risk profiles and regulatory expectations. This holistic approach ensures that AIs maintain sound governance and risk management practices in line with regulatory requirements and industry best practices.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 212, "prompt_tokens": 393, "total_tokens": 605, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
