These eight inherent risks are described in section 2 below. The risk-based supervisory approach, which emphasises effective planning and examiner judgement, customises examinations to suit the size and activities of AIs and to concentrate examiner resources on areas that expose the AI concerned to the greatest degree of risk.)\n##\n(HKMA<|>AUTHORIZED INSTITUTIONS<|>RISK-BASED SUPERVISORY APPROACH<|>TRUE<|>NONE<|>NONE<|>The HKMA applies a risk-based supervisory approach that includes qualitative analysis of risk profiles, such as changes in CAMEL ratings of Authorized Institutions, incorporating both quantitative financial data and forward-looking judgement based on risk management systems and internal controls.<|>Under the risk-based approach, a change in the CAMEL rating of an AI may result from the qualitative analysis of its risk profile in addition to the more traditional quantitative analysis of its financial data. The risk-focused examination process places more emphasis on an evaluation of the quality of risk management systems and internal controls. A risk management rating is assigned taking into account the results of the on-site examination and formally incorporated into the management component of the CAMEL rating.)\n<|COMPLETE|>", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 358, "prompt_tokens": 1564, "total_tokens": 1922, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 1152, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
