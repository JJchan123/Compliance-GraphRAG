This approach ensures that risk management is seamlessly integrated into business strategies, allowing AIs to assess the performance of their business units in relation to the risks undertaken. By implementing this system, organizations can ensure that excessive risks are not rewarded, thereby promoting a balanced evaluation where returns are commensurate with the level of risk assumed. Overall, RISK-ADJUSTED PERFORMANCE MEASUREMENT serves as a critical framework for fostering responsible and sustainable performance within AI-driven business environments.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 129, "prompt_tokens": 325, "total_tokens": 454, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
