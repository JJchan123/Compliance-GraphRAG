The Internal Audit Function serves as the third line of defence, independently evaluating the effectiveness of internal controls, risk management frameworks, and governance processes. It maintains critical relationships with internal controls, audits, operational risk management, and various reporting mechanisms including financial, operational, and regulatory reports. The HKMA assesses the independence and performance of this function to determine the scope of its risk-focused on-site examinations. This ecosystem highlights the pivotal role of the Internal Audit Function in ensuring robust risk governance, compliance with AML/CFT systems, and effective supervisory engagement within the banking sector.\",\n  \"findings\": [\n    {\n      \"summary\": \"Internal Audit Function as the Third Line of Defence\",\n      \"explanation\": \"The Internal Audit Function operates independently within Authorized Institutions, providing assurance on the effectiveness of risk management frameworks, internal controls, and governance processes. It constitutes the third line of defence, evaluating the first and second lines to support a strong control environment endorsed by the Board and senior management. This function conducts comprehensive reviews and escalates material risk management deficiencies to senior management and the Board, reinforcing sound risk management and compliance. Its independence and performance are critical for effective governance and are assessed by the HKMA to influence supervisory approaches [Data: Entities (47, 228); Relationships (408, 153)].\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"summary\": \"Role in Evaluating Internal Controls and Audits\",\n      \"explanation\": \"The Internal Audit Function systematically evaluates and tests the adequacy and effectiveness of internal controls within the AI. It conducts audits that assess risk management systems and compliance processes, ensuring that operational and regulatory requirements are met. These audits provide objective verification of corrective actions and help identify material weaknesses requiring high-level attention.
