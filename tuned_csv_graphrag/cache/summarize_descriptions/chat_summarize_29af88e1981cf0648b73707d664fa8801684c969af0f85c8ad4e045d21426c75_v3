This guideline serves as a comprehensive framework that outlines detailed policies and procedures designed to enable Authorized Institutions to effectively identify, assess, and manage risks related to money laundering (ML) and terrorist financing (TF). Compliance with the AML/CFT Guideline ensures that Authorized Institutions implement robust risk management practices, maintain regulatory standards, and uphold the integrity of the financial system by mitigating potential AML/CFT threats. The guideline thus plays a critical role in guiding Authorized Institutions in establishing sound governance, internal controls, and ongoing monitoring mechanisms to fulfill their legal and regulatory obligations in the AML/CFT domain.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 169, "prompt_tokens": 295, "total_tokens": 464, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
