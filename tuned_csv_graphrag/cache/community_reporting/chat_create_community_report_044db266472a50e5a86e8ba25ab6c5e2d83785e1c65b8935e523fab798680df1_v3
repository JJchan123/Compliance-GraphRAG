Authorized Institutions implement sound valuation methodologies to accurately measure portfolio positions, including complex financial instruments, under both normal and stressed market conditions. Stress testing processes rely on these valuation practices to evaluate the resilience of the AI’s risk profile under adverse scenarios, with results communicated to governance bodies such as the Board and Risk Committee. Expert judgement complements quantitative risk models by providing qualitative assessments that address model limitations, thereby enhancing risk decision-making and compliance robustness. These interrelated entities form a critical ecosystem ensuring effective risk management, governance oversight, and regulatory compliance within the banking sector.\",\n  \"findings\": [\n    {\n      \"summary\": \"Sound valuation practices are foundational to accurate risk measurement.\",\n      \"explanation\": \"Authorized Institutions employ sound valuation practices to value positions, including complex products and financial instruments, under both normal and stressed market conditions. These practices include the capacity to use alternative valuation methods when primary inputs become unreliable or unavailable, ensuring continuous accuracy in portfolio valuation. This foundational role supports effective risk management by providing reliable data for decision-making and regulatory reporting. The importance of these practices is underscored by their direct application by AIs to maintain portfolio measurement integrity [Data: Entities (357); Relationships (780)].\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"summary\": \"Stress testing evaluates the resilience of risk profiles under adverse conditions.\",\n      \"explanation\": \"Stress testing is a critical risk management process conducted by Authorized Institutions to assess how their risk profiles would perform under adverse or stressed market scenarios. The outcomes of stress testing depend heavily on the accuracy of valuation practices to reflect true portfolio values under stress. Results from stress testing are reported to key governance bodies such as the Board, Risk Committee, and senior management, enabling informed incorporation into risk management strategies and business planning. This process ensures that AIs can anticipate vulnerabilities and prepare mitigation strategies effectively [Data: Entities (330); Relationships (783)].\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"summary\": \"Expert judgement enhances risk decision-making beyond quantitative models.\",\n      \"explanation\": \"Expert judgement serves as a qualitative approach that complements quantitative risk measurement methods and models within Authorized Institutions. It involves critical analysis and professional evaluation of risks, addressing both practical and conceptual limitations inherent in quantitative models. By integrating expert judgement, AIs ensure more balanced and comprehensive risk decisions that go beyond relying solely on model outputs. This qualitative input strengthens the robustness of risk management and compliance frameworks, supporting sound governance and regulatory adherence [Data: Entities (351); Relationships (776)].\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"summary\": \"Interdependence between valuation practices and stress testing ensures robust risk assessment.\",\n      \"explanation\": \"The relationship between sound valuation practices and stress testing is symbiotic; stress testing outcomes depend on the accuracy and reliability of valuation methodologies to assess portfolio values under stressed scenarios. Without robust valuation practices, stress testing results could be misleading, undermining the effectiveness of risk management frameworks.
