Key entities include the Board, senior management, specialized committees, and various risk management components such as risk assessment models, contingency plans, and risk limit structures. The Board holds ultimate responsibility for risk oversight, approving policies, and ensuring compliance with corporate governance frameworks and legislative requirements like the Banking (Capital) Ordinance. Senior management operationalizes these frameworks by monitoring risk exposures, implementing risk controls, and ensuring staff competence. Specialized committees support the Board by handling delegated risk management tasks.

It approves risk definitions, strategies, policies, and frameworks, ensuring their proper implementation and periodic review to adapt to evolving business and market conditions. The Board also delegates authority to specialized committees and appoints key risk management personnel such as the Chief Risk Officer. It ensures that risk limits align with the institution's risk appetite and that risk management functions are adequately resourced and independent.
