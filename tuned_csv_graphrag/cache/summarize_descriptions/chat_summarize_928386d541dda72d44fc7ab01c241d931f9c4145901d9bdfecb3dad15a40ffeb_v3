It represents the potential loss arising from a borrower or counterparty failing to meet contractual obligations or from a deterioration in asset or credit quality. This risk can significantly impact an AI’s financial condition and its CAMEL rating, which evaluates capital adequacy, asset quality, management, earnings, and liquidity. Effective management of credit risk involves implementing robust credit approval and review functions, establishing risk limits and policies, utilizing credit risk evaluation systems, and conducting provisioning assessments to mitigate potential losses. The assessment of credit risk includes evaluating both the probability of default by the borrower, counterparty, or issuer, and the potential financial exposure to the AI in the event of such default. Overall, credit risk is a critical component of the risk framework that ensures the soundness and stability of financial institutions under the regulatory oversight of the HKMA.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 196, "prompt_tokens": 547, "total_tokens": 743, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
