To support this role, the Board may delegate specific risk management tasks and authorities to a specialized Board-level Risk Committee, which operates under formal mandates established by the Board. The Risk Committee functions as a designated committee of the Board, providing focused oversight on risk management policies, including the approval of new product approval policies, and regularly reports its findings and recommendations back to the Board. Additionally, the Board ensures effective communication and information exchange between the Risk Committee and other key committees, such as the Audit Committee, to facilitate comprehensive risk oversight. Through this governance framework, the Risk Committee supports the Board in informed decision-making and the ongoing management of risk within the organization.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 159, "prompt_tokens": 455, "total_tokens": 614, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
