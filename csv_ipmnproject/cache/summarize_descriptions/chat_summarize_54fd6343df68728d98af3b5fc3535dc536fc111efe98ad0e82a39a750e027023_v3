These assessments are designed to evaluate the risk profiles of Authorized Institutions (AIs) and ensure that they effectively identify and manage risks associated with money laundering and terrorist financing. The HKMA mandates that AIs perform these risk assessments to pinpoint vulnerabilities related to money laundering and terrorist financing, thereby enhancing the overall integrity and security of the financial system in Hong Kong.
