The Risk Management Policies serve as formal guidelines that govern risk identification, assessment, and control, including the approval of new products or services. These policies mandate consultation with the New Product Committee and require cost and benefit analyses to evaluate new offerings. The New Product Committee, comprising representatives from various functions, escalates significant risk concerns to the Chief Risk Officer.
