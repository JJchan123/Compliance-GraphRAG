This responsibility includes verifying the identity of beneficial owners within ownership chains to prevent money laundering and other financial crimes. Authorized Institutions must pay particular attention to beneficial owners holding significant shares, obtaining declarations regarding any changes in shareholding. They also assess the influence of beneficial owners, especially when these individuals or entities are linked to high-risk jurisdictions, to apply appropriate Anti-Money Laundering and Counter Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT) controls.
