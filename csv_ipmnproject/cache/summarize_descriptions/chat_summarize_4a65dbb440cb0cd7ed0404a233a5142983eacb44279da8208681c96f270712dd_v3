This approach ensures that risk management is an integral part of performance assessments, thereby promoting a balanced evaluation that discourages excessive risk-taking. Additionally, it serves as a system for assessing the performance of various business units within AIs, ensuring that their activities are scrutinized for associated risks. By doing so, RISK-ADJUSTED PERFORMANCE MEASUREMENT aims to create a framework where performance is not only measured by outcomes but also by the risks undertaken to achieve those outcomes, fostering a culture of responsible risk management within organizations.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 140, "prompt_tokens": 291, "total_tokens": 431, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
